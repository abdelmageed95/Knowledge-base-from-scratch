In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.\""

There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.\\n\\n\\n== Early years ==\\n\\nNikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856. His father, Milutin Tesla (1819–1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Tesla\\'s mother, Đuka Mandić (1822–1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother\\'s genetics and influence. Tesla\\'s progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla\\'s father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.\\n\\nTesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this \"mysterious phenomena\" made him want \"to know more of this wonderful force\". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating. He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla\\'s father (who had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood), promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter\\'s garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain\\'s works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.He enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. In his autobiography Tesla said he worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams (nearly twice as many as required) and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" At Graz, Tesla noted his fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating. But by his third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla wasn\\'t studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.\\n\\nTesla\\'s family did not hear from him after he left school. There was a rumor amongst his classmates that he had drowned in the nearby Mur River but in January one of them ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor across the border in Slovenia and reported that encounter to Tesla\\'s family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, Milutin finally located his son and tried to convince him to return home and take up his education in Prague. Tesla returned to Gospić later that month when he was deported for not having a residence permit. Tesla\\'s father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.\\nIn January 1880, two of Tesla\\'s uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospić for Prague, where he was to study. He arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University; he had never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at the university as an auditor but he did not receive grades for the courses.\\n\\n\\n=== Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange ===\\nTesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.\\n\\n\\n== Working at Edison ==\\nIn 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.\\n\\n\\n=== Moving to the United States ===\\n\\nIn 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in that city. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla\\'s autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, he ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night. After Tesla told them he had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\". One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but it required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing the company to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla\\'s designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. What event precipitated his leaving is unclear. It may have been over a bonus he did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses he believed he had earned. In his autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but it turned out to be a practical joke\". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"Tesla, you don\\'t understand our American humor\". The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and the company did not have that amount of cash (equivalent to $1.4 million in 2021) on hand. Tesla\\'s diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note he scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good by to the Edison Machine Works\".\\n\\n\\n== Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing ==\\nSoon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla\\'s name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla\\'s new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on its advanced features.\\nThe investors showed little interest in Tesla\\'s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla\\'s company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to me like a mockery\".\\n\\n\\n== AC and the induction motor ==\\n\\nIn late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. The two men were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla\\'s new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, they agreed to back the inventor financially and handle his patents. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go ⅓ to Tesla, ⅓ to Peck and Brown, and ⅓ to fund development. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.\\nIn 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current (AC), a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor (a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882). This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify it was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony (who tested the motor) and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system he was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla\\'s patent would probably control the market.\\n\\nIn July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla\\'s polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($57,600 in today\\'s dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company\\'s Pittsburgh labs.During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city\\'s streetcars. He found it a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla\\'s motor), but they soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla\\'s induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.\\n\\n\\n=== Market turmoil ===\\nTesla\\'s demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouse\\'s subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla\\'s motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in their loans to Westinghouse Electric. The sudden cash shortage forced the company to refinance its debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it was even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if he did not meet the demands of his lenders, he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and he agreed to release the company from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla\\'s patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric (a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston).\\n\\n\\n== New York laboratories ==\\n\\nThe money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years working out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street (1889–1892), the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue (1892–1895), and sixth and seventh floors of 46 & 48 East Houston Street (1895–1902). Tesla and his hired staff conducted some of his most significant work in these workshops.\\n\\n\\n=== Tesla coil ===\\n\\nIn the summer of 1889, Tesla traveled to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris and learned of Heinrich Hertz\\'s 1886–1888 experiments that proved the existence of electromagnetic radiation, including radio waves. Tesla found this new discovery \"refreshing\" and decided to explore it more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments, Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator he had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with his \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. Later called the Tesla coil, it would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. He would use this resonant transformer circuit in his later wireless power work.\\n\\n\\n=== Citizenship ===\\nOn 30 July 1891, aged 35, Tesla became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In the same year, he patented his Tesla coil.\\n\\n\\n=== Wireless lighting ===\\n\\nAfter 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with his Tesla coil. He attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where he lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. He spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of his findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that he was sure a system like his could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting it through the Earth.Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE (along with the Institute of Radio Engineers).\\n\\n\\n=== Polyphase system and the Columbian Exposition ===\\n\\nBy the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla\\'s induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system it would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding their polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\". They believed that Tesla\\'s patents gave them patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago where the company had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and it was a key event in the history of AC power, as the company demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla\\'s induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making it stand on end.Tesla visited the fair for a week during its six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration he had previously performed throughout America and Europe; these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.An observer noted:\\n\\nWithin the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. These were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to them, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. These were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, \"where they produced so much wonder and astonishment\".\\n\\n\\n=== Steam-powered oscillating generator ===\\n\\nDuring his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that he patented that year, something he thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.\\n\\n\\n=== Consulting on Niagara ===\\nIn 1893, Edward Dean Adams, who headed up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla\\'s opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla\\'s advice and Westinghouse\\'s demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.\\n\\n\\n=== The Nikola Tesla Company ===\\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla\\'s lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla\\'s patents for decades to come.\\n\\n\\n=== Lab fire ===\\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla\\'s lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla\\'s 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla\\'s ongoing projects, but it also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?\" After the fire Tesla moved to 46 & 48 East Houston Street and rebuilt his lab on the 6th and 7th floors.\\n\\n\\n=== X-ray experimentation ===\\n\\nStarting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in his laboratory in previous experiments (later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\"). His early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen\\'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.\\n\\nIn March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen\\'s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging (radiography), Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes.  A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him:\\n\\nTesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his \"electric gun,\" Tesla said, \"The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations\".\\n\\n\\n=== Radio remote control ===\\nIn 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla tried to sell his idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but they showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used it in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while he was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.\\n\\n\\n== Wireless power ==\\n\\nFrom the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of his time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\\nAt the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for his intended purposes since this form of \"invisible light\" would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming \"hopelessly lost\".By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that he might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in his East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth\\'s atmosphere was conductive, he proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet (9,100 m) in altitude, where he thought the lower pressure would allow him to send high voltages (millions of volts) long distances.\\n\\n\\n=== Colorado Springs ===\\n\\nTo further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.  There he could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of his New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund his experiments, he convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 ($3,110,800 in today\\'s dollars) to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought he was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments. Upon his arrival, he told reporters that he planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.\\n\\nThere, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet (41 m) in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage. The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led him to (incorrectly) conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.\\nDuring his time at his laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. He mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. He expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier\\'s Weekly article entitled \"Talking With Planets\", where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi\\'s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S (dot/dot/dot) in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on his findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", appeared in the June 1900 edition of the magazine. He explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of his work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and his Colorado Springs experiments.\\n\\n\\n=== Wardenclyffe ===\\n\\nTesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what he thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria\\'s Palm Garden (the hotel where he was living at the time), The Players Club, and Delmonico\\'s. In March 1901, he obtained $150,000 ($4,666,200 in today\\'s dollars) from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles (161 km) east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi\\'s radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his own. He approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi\\'s success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\". Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. The tower was erected to its full height of 187 feet (57 m). In June 1902, Tesla moved his lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi\\'s system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla\\'s project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla\\'s part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually amounted to $20,000 ($516,700 in today\\'s dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.\\n\\n\\n== Later years ==\\nAfter Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan; after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan\\'s son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing his patents. He went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914; rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because he could not afford the rent; and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, he was effectively bankrupt. Most of his patents had run out and he was having trouble with the new inventions he was trying to develop.\\n\\n\\n=== Bladeless turbine ===\\n\\nOn his 50th birthday, in 1906, Tesla demonstrated a 200 horsepower (150 kilowatts) 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine. During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp. Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers. He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company, but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.\\n\\n\\n=== Wireless lawsuits ===\\nWhen World War I broke out, the British cut the transatlantic telegraph cable linking the US to Germany in order to control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of his wireless tuning patents. Marconi\\'s initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before it was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that it infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Tesla\\'s 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi\\'s claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi\\'s claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.\\n\\n\\n=== Nobel Prize rumors ===\\nOn 6 November 1915, a Reuters news agency report from London had the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to William Henry Bragg and Lawrence Bragg \"for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays\". There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\"; a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after he is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other\\'s achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937).\\n\\n\\n=== Other ideas, awards, and patents ===\\nTesla won numerous medals and awards over this time. They include:\\n\\nGrand Officer of the Order of St. Sava (Serbia, 1892)\\nElliott Cresson Medal (Franklin Institute, USA, 1894)\\nGrand Cross of the Order of Prince Danilo I (Montenegro, 1895)\\nAIEE Edison Medal (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, USA, 1917)\\nGrand Cross of the Order of St. Sava (Yugoslavia, 1926)\\nCross Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown (Yugoslavia, 1931)\\nJohn Scott Medal (Franklin Institute & Philadelphia City Council, USA, 1934)\\nOrder of the White Eagle (Yugoslavia, 1936)\\nGrand Cross of the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1937)\\nMedal of the University of Paris (Paris, France, 1937)\\nThe Medal of the University St. Clement of Ochrida (Sofia, Bulgaria, 1939)\\nTesla attempted to market several devices based on the production of ozone. These included his 1900 Tesla Ozone Company selling an 1896 patented device based on his Tesla Coil, used to bubble ozone through different types of oils to make a therapeutic gel. He also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, he crafted \"a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,\" wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, \"saturating [the schoolroom] with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or \\'bath.\\'\" The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.\\nIn the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen (a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar). Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high-frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France\\'s first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla\\'s general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, \"(Tesla) was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly\".In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL), which \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000. Although the aircraft has been described as impractical, it has early resemblances to the V-22 Osprey used by the US military. At this point Tesla closed his remaining office located at 350 Madison Ave, having moved there two years earlier.\\n\\n\\n=== Living circumstances ===\\nTesla lived at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City from 1900 and ran up a large bill. He moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. He began feeding them at the window of his hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. He said that he had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. He spent over $2,000 to care for the bird, including a device he built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed. Tesla stated:\\n\\nI have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.\\nTesla\\'s unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. He was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point he also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.\\nTesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company began paying him $125 per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being couched as a \"consulting fee\" to get around Tesla\\'s aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of \"unspecified settlement\". In any case, Westinghouse provided the funds for Tesla for the rest of his life.\\n\\n\\n=== Birthday press conferences ===\\n\\nIn 1931, a young journalist whom Tesla befriended, Kenneth M. Swezey, organized a celebration for the inventor\\'s 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The cover caption \"All the world\\'s his power house\" noted his contribution to electrical power generation.\\nThe party went so well that Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink—featuring dishes of his own creation. He invited the press in order to see his inventions and hear stories about his past exploits, views on current events, and sometimes baffling claims.\\n\\nAt the 1932 party, Tesla claimed he had invented a motor that would run on cosmic rays.\\nIn 1933 at age 77, Tesla told reporters at the event that, after 35 years of work, he was on the verge of producing proof of a new form of energy. He claimed it was a theory of energy that was \"violently opposed\" to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. He also told reporters he was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters he had designed a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He called it \"teleforce\", but was usually referred to as his death ray. Tesla described it as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but, in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.In 1935 at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. He claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device (which he expected would earn him $100 million within two years) he told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. He went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure. He also explained a new technique he developed using his oscillators he called \"Telegeodynamics\", using it to transmit vibrations into the ground that he claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In his 1937 Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador. On questions concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, \"But it is not an experiment ... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.\"\\n\\n\\n== Death ==\\n\\nIn the fall of 1937 at the age of 81, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown to the ground. His back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident. The full extent of his injuries was never known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor, an almost lifelong custom, and never fully recovered.On 7 January 1943, at the age of 86, Tesla died alone in Room 3327 of the Hotel New Yorker. His body was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla\\'s room, ignoring the \"do not disturb\" sign that Tesla had placed on his door two days earlier. Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembley examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.\\nTwo days later the Federal Bureau of Investigation ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla\\'s belongings. John G. Trump, a professor at M.I.T. and a well-known electrical engineer serving as a technical aide to the National Defense Research Committee, was called in to analyze the Tesla items, which were being held in custody. After a three-day investigation, Trump\\'s report concluded that there was nothing which would constitute a hazard in unfriendly hands, stating:\\n\\nHis [Tesla\\'s] thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character often concerned with the production and wireless transmission of power; but did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.\\nIn a box purported to contain a part of Tesla\\'s \"death ray\", Trump found a 45-year-old multidecade resistance box.\\nOn 10 January 1943, New York City mayor Fiorello La Guardia read a eulogy written by Slovene-American author Louis Adamic live over the WNYC radio while violin pieces \"Ave Maria\" and \"Tamo daleko\" were played in the background. On 12 January, two thousand people attended a state funeral for Tesla at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. After the funeral, Tesla\\'s body was taken to the Ferncliff Cemetery in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated. The following day, a second service was conducted by prominent priests in the Trinity Chapel (today\\'s Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint Sava) in New York City.\\n\\n\\n=== Estate ===\\nIn 1952, following pressure from Tesla\\'s nephew, Sava Kosanović, Tesla\\'s entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanović\\'s secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla\\'s ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes are displayed in a gold-plated sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.\\n\\n\\n== Patents ==\\n\\nTesla obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla\\'s patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. There are a minimum of 278 known patents issued to Tesla in 26 countries. Many of Tesla\\'s patents were in the United States, Britain, and Canada, but many other patents were approved in countries around the globe. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.\\n\\n\\n== Personal life and character ==\\n\\n\\n=== Appearance ===\\n\\nTesla was 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighed 142 pounds (64 kg), with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926. His appearance was described by newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane as \"almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico\\'s regularly\". He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities, an appearance he maintained so as to further his business relationships. He was also described as having light eyes, \"very big hands\", and \"remarkably big\" thumbs.\\n\\n\\n=== Eidetic memory ===\\nTesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessed a photographic memory. He was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light appeared before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail. Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.\\n\\n\\n=== Relationships ===\\nTesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities. He once said in earlier years that he felt he could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This \"new woman\" was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"In place of the soft-voiced, a gentlewoman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.\" Although he told a reporter in later years that he sometimes felt that by not marrying, he had made too great a sacrifice to his work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation he needed in his work.\\nTesla was asocial and prone to seclude himself with his work. However, when he did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force\". His secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul\". Tesla\\'s friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink\".Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain; they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. Twain notably described Tesla\\'s induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone\". At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said he could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and his wife.Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight. He was quick to criticize clothing; on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress. When Thomas Edison died, in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to The New York Times, buried in an extensive coverage of Edison\\'s life:\\n\\nHe had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene ... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor\\'s instinct and practical American sense.\\n\\n\\n=== Sleep habits ===\\nTesla claimed never to sleep more than two hours per night. However, he did admit to \"dozing\" from time to time \"to recharge his batteries\". During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: \"I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he] ... work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Work habits ===\\nTesla worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico\\'s restaurant and later the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Tesla then telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. \"The meal was required to be ready at eight o\\'clock ... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla then resumed his work, often until 3:00 a.m.\"For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles (13 and 16 km) per day. He curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, \"Suppose I made up my mind to murder you,\" he said, \"In a second you would know it. Now, isn\\'t that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?\" In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.\\n\\n\\n== Views and beliefs ==\\n\\n\\n=== On experimental and theoretical physics ===\\nTesla disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller subatomic particles, stating there was no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge. He believed that if electrons existed at all, they were some fourth state of matter or \"sub-atom\" that could exist only in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity. Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—they could not change state or be split in any way. He was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. He was also critical of Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, saying:\\n\\nI hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.\\nTesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\". He stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that he hoped to soon give it to the world. Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.\\n\\n\\n=== On society ===\\n\\nTesla is widely considered by his biographers to have been a humanist in philosophical outlook. This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.\\nTesla expressed the belief that human \"pity\" had come to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\". Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, he advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview he stated:\\n\\n... man\\'s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.\\nIn 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity\\'s future would be run by \"Queen Bees\". He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" (20 December 1914). Tesla believed that the League of Nations was not a remedy for the times and issues.\\n\\n\\n=== On religion ===\\nTesla was raised an Orthodox Christian. Later in life he did not consider himself to be a \"believer in the orthodox sense\", said he opposed religious fanaticism, and said \"Buddhism and Christianity are the greatest religions both in number of disciples and in importance.\" He also said \"To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end\" and \"what we call \\'soul\\' or \\'spirit,\\' is nothing more than the sum of the functionings of the body. When this functioning ceases, the \\'soul\\' or the \\'spirit\\' ceases likewise.\"\\n\\n\\n== Literary works ==\\nTesla wrote a number of books and articles for magazines and journals. Among his books are My Inventions: The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla, compiled and edited by Ben Johnston in 1983 from a series of 1919 magazine articles by Tesla which were republished in 1977; The Fantastic Inventions of Nikola Tesla (1993), compiled and edited by David Hatcher Childress; and The Tesla Papers.\\nMany of Tesla\\'s writings are freely available online, including the article \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", published in The Century Magazine in 1900, and the article \"Experiments with Alternate Currents of High Potential and High Frequency\", published in his book Inventions, Researches and Writings of Nikola Tesla.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy and honors ==\\n\\nTesla\\'s legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics, and video games. The impact of the technologies invented or envisioned by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.\\n\\n\\n=== Things named after Tesla ===\\n\\n\\n==== Awards ====\\nThe Nikola Tesla Award\\n\\n\\n==== Enterprises and organizations ====\\nTesla, an electrotechnical conglomerate in the former Czechoslovakia\\nTesla, Inc, an American electric car manufacturer\\nNikola Motor Company, an American hydrogen and electric class 8 truck manufacturer\\nEricsson Nikola Tesla, Croatian affiliate of the Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer Ericsson\\nTesla Electric Light and Manufacturing\\nTesla, an American rock band formed in Sacramento, California, in late 1982\\n\\n\\n==== Holidays and events ====\\nDay of Science, Serbia, 10 July\\nDay of Nikola Tesla, Association of Teachers in Vojvodina, 4–10 July\\nDay of Nikola Tesla, Niagara Falls, 10 July\\nNikola Tesla Day in Croatia, 10 July\\nNikola Tesla annual electric vehicle rally in Croatia\\nIn Ontario, Canada, the provincial legislature proclaimed 10 July as an annual recognition of his birth.\\n\\n\\n==== Measures ====\\nTesla, an SI-derived unit of magnetic flux density (or magnetic inductivity)\\n\\n\\n==== Places ====\\n\\nNikola Tesla Memorial Center in Smiljan, Croatia\\nBelgrade Nikola Tesla Airport\\nNikola Tesla Museum Archive in Belgrade\\nNikola Tesla Technical Museum in Zagreb, Croatia was named after the scientist in 2015\\nTPP Nikola Tesla, the largest power plant in Serbia, first commissioned in 1970\\n128 streets in Croatia had been named after Nikola Tesla as of November 2008, making him the eighth most common street name origin in the country.\\nTesla, a 26 kilometer-wide crater on the far side of the moon\\n2244 Tesla, a minor planet\\n\\n\\n==== Schools ====\\nTesla STEM High School created in 2012 in Redmond, Washington as a choice school with a focus on STEM subjects.

It features a statue of Tesla designed by sculptor Mile Blažević.\\nA plaque depicting a relief of Nikola Tesla is present on the Old City Hall in Zagreb, Croatia\\'s capital, commemorating his proposal to build an alternating current power station, which he made to the city council. The plaque quotes Tesla\\'s statement, given in the building on 24 May 1892, which reads: \"As a son of this country, I consider it my duty to help the City of Zagreb in every way, either through counsel or through action\" (Croatian: \"Smatram svojom dužnošću da kao rođeni sin svoje zemlje pomognem gradu Zagrebu u svakom pogledu savjetom i činom\").\\nOn 7 July 2006, on the corner of Masarykova and Preradovićeva streets in the Lower Town area in Zagreb, a monument of Tesla was unveiled. This monument was designed by Ivan Meštrović in 1952 and was transferred from the Zagreb-based Ruđer Bošković Institute where it had spent previous decades.\\nA monument to Tesla was established at Niagara Falls, New York. This monument portraying Tesla reading a set of notes was sculpted by Frano Kršinić. It was presented to the United States by Yugoslavia in 1976 and is an identical copy of the monument standing in front of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Electrical Engineering.\\nA monument of Tesla standing on a portion of an alternator was established at Queen Victoria Park in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. The monument was officially unveiled on 9 July 2006 on the 150th anniversary of Tesla\\'s birth. The monument was sponsored by St. George Serbian Church, Niagara Falls, and designed by Les Drysdale of Hamilton, Ontario. Drysdale\\'s design was the winning design from an international competition.\\nA monument of Tesla was unveiled in Baku in 2013. Presidents Ilham Aliyev and Tomislav Nikolić attended a ceremony of unveiling\\nIn 2012 Jane Alcorn, president of the nonprofit group Tesla Science Center at Wardenclyffe, and Matthew Inman, creator of web cartoon The Oatmeal, raised a total of $2,220,511 – $1,370,511 from a campaign and $850,000 from a New York State grant—to buy the property where Wardenclyffe Tower once stood and eventually turn it into a museum.

              " 'Ahmed Hassan Zewail (Arabic: أحمد حسن زويل, Egyptian Arabic: [ˈæħmæd ˈħæsæn zeˈweːl]; February 26, 1946 – August 2, 2016) was an Egyptian American chemist, known as the \"father of femtochemistry\". He was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry and became the first Egyptian to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field, and the second African to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, Professor of Physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.\\n\\n\\n== Early life and education ==\\nAhmed Hasan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, Egypt, and was raised in Desouk. He received a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Chemistry from Alexandria University before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania supervised by Robin M. Hochstrasser.\\n\\n\\n== Career ==\\nAfter completing his PhD, Zewail did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Charles Bonner Harris. Following this, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, and he made the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on 5 March 1982. Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.Zewail had been nominated and participated in President Barack Obama\\'s Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation\\'s leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.\\n\\n\\n=== Research ===\\nZewail\\'s key work was a pioneer of femtochemistry—i.e. the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions. Zewail became known as the \"father of femtochemistry\".\\n\\n\\n=== Political work ===\\nIn a speech at Cairo University on June 4, 2009, US President Barack Obama proclaimed a new Science Envoy program as part of a \"new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.\" In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.When asked about rumors that he might contest the 2011 Egyptian presidential election, Ahmed Zewail said: \"I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist.\"During the 2011 Egyptian protests he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside Ayman Nour, Mubarak\\'s rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.\\nZewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak\\'s resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei. He played a critical role during this time as described by Egyptian Media.\\n\\n\\n=== Awards and honors ===\\nIn 1999, Zewail became the first Egyptian to receive a science Nobel Prize when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Zewail gave his Nobel Lecture on \"Femtochemistry: Atomic-Scale Dynamics of the Chemical Bond Using Ultrafast Lasers\". In 1999, he received Egypt\\'s highest state honor, the Grand Collar of the Nile. In October 2006, Zewail received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science for \"his pioneering development of the new field of femtoscience and for his seminal contributions to the revolutionary discipline of physical biology, creating new ways for better understanding the functional behavior of biological systems by directly visualizing them in the four dimensions of space and time.\"Other international awards include the King Faisal International Prize (1989), Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1993) awarded to him by the Wolf Foundation, the Tolman Award (1997), the Robert A. Welch Award (1997), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2000), the Othmer Gold Medal (2009), the Priestley Medal (2011) from the American Chemical Society and the Davy Medal (2011) from the Royal Society.Zewail became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1989 the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993, and the American Philosophical Society in 1998. Zewail was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2001. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2002. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Lund University in Sweden in May 2003 and was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Cambridge University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science in 2006. In May 2008, Zewail received an honorary doctorate from Complutense University of Madrid. In February 2009, Zewail was awarded an honorary doctorate in arts and sciences by the University of Jordan. In May 2010, he gave the commencement address at Southwestern University. On 3 October 2011 he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Glasgow. On 19 May 2014, he was awarded an honorary degree from Yale University. The Zewail city of science and technology, established in 2000 and revived in 2011, is named in his honour.\\n\\n\\n=== Honorary Degrees ===\\nZewail was bestowed honorary degrees by the following institutions: \\nUniversity of Oxford, UK (1991); \\nThe American University in Cairo, Egypt (1993);\\nKatholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium (1997);\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, USA (1997);\\nUniversity of Lausanne, Switzerland (1997);\\nSwinburne University of Technology, Australia (1999);\\nArab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport, Egypt (1999);\\nD.Sc.

              " 'Dr. Ali Moustafa Mosharafa\\' (Egyptian Arabic: على مصطفى مشرفة) (11 July 1898 – 16 January 1950) was an Egyptian theoretical physicist. He was professor of applied mathematics in the Faculty of Science at Cairo University, and also served as its first dean. He contributed to the development of the quantum theory as well as the theory of relativity.\\n\\n\\n== Biography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Birth and early life ===\\nHe was the youngest student in his class, but the most knowledgeable. He obtained his primary certificate in 1910 ranking second nationwide. At the age of 16, he obtained his Baccalaureate in 1914 to become the youngest student at that time to be awarded such a certificate, also ranking second. He preferred to enroll in the Teachers\\' College rather than the faculties of Medicine or Engineering due to his deep interest in mathematics.\\nHe graduated in 1917. Due to his excellence in mathematics, the Egyptian Ministry of Education sent him to England where he obtained BSc (Honors) from the University of Nottingham, 1920. The Egyptian University consented to grant Mosharafa another scholarship to complete his doctoral thesis. During his stay in London, many of his scientific researches were published in prominent science magazines. He obtained a PhD in 1923 from King\\'s College London in the shortest possible time permissible according to the regulations there. In 1924 Mosharafa was awarded the degree of Doctor of Science, the first Egyptian and 11th scientist in the entire world to obtain such a degree.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic career ===\\nHe became a teacher in the Higher Teachers\\' college in Cairo University, he became an associate professor of mathematics in the Faculty of Science because he was under the age of 30, the minimum age required for fulfilling the post of a professor. In 1926 his promotion to professor was raised in the Parliament, then chaired by Saad Zaghloul. The Parliament lauded his qualifications and merits which surpassed those of the English dean of the faculty and he was promoted to professor.He was the first Egyptian professor of applied mathematics in the Faculty of Science. He became dean of the faculty in 1936, at the age of 38. He remained in office as a dean of the Faculty of Science until he died in 1950.\\n\\n\\n== Scientific achievements ==\\nOver the 1920s-1930s, he studied Maxwell\\'s equations and the special relativity and he had correspondence with Albert Einstein.Mosharafa published 25 original papers in distinguished scientific journals about quantum theory, the theory of relativity, and the relation between radiation and matter. He published around 12 scientific books about relativity and mathematics. His books, on the theory of relativity, were translated into English, French, German and Polish. He also translated 10 books of astronomy and mathematics into Arabic.\\nMusharafa was interested in the history of science, especially in studying the contributions of Arab scientists in the Middle Ages. With his student M. Morsi Ahmad, he published al-Khwārizmī\\'s book The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing (Kitab al-Jabr wa-l-Muqabala).\\nHe also was interested in the relation between music and mathematics and helped to establish the Egyptian society of music fans in 1945.\\n\\n\\n== Social and political views ==\\nHe was the first to call for social reform and development based on scientific research. He was keen on disseminating public scientific awareness and wrote several articles and books for the public about science in simple forms. He, further, encouraged translations into Arabic. He contributed in writing the Arab scientific encyclopedia and books on the scientific heritage of the Arabs as well. He was against the use of atomic energy in war and warned against the exploitation of science as a means of destruction.\\n\\n\\n== Honors ==\\nHe was given the title \"Pasha\" by King Farouq, but he declined the title claiming that no title is worthier than a sciences PhD.\\nA laboratory and an auditorium are named after him in the Faculty of Science, Cairo University, Egypt.\\nAn annual award carrying his name has been initiated by his family to be given to the cleverest student in mathematics.\\nEgypt & Europe Magazine published a cartoon of him standing between Russia and the USA holding in his hands rolled paper, and both superpowers awaiting him to unfold the secrets of science. ??? \\nIn 1947 the Institute for Advanced Study invited Mosharafa to join as a visiting professor at Princeton University, but the king disapproved.\\nThe Newton-Mosharafa Fund was named after him and after Sir Isaac Newton\\n\\n\\n== Books and papers ==\\nHe wrote 26 significant papers including theoretical explanations of natural phenomena. He wrote 15 books on relativity and mathematics. Among which is a book on the theory of relativity translated into English, French, German and Polish. It was reprinted in the USA. He produced around 15 scientific books about relativity, mathematics, atom and space invasion.

              " 'Sir Isaac Newton  (25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author (described in his time as a \"natural philosopher\") widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.\\nIn the Principia, Newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. Newton used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler\\'s laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System\\'s heliocentricity. He demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. Newton\\'s inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.\\nNewton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. His work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.\\nNewton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. He was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, Newton served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden (1696–1699) and Master (1699–1727) of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society (1703–1727).\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nIsaac Newton was born (according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time) on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 (NS 4 January 1643), \"an hour or two after midnight\", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough (née Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.\" Newton\\'s mother had three children (Mary, Benjamin and Hannah) from her second marriage.From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King\\'s School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. His mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated. Henry Stokes, master at The King\\'s School, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a subsizar—paying his way by performing valet\\'s duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his MA. At that time the college\\'s teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street, through whom he learned of Kepler\\'s work. He set down in his notebook a series of \"Quaestiones\" about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton\\'s private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.\\nIn April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity. Fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient. However, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way. Nevertheless, Newton managed to avoid it by means of special permission from Charles II.\\nHis studies had impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of Trinity two years later); in 1669 Newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his MA. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1672.\\n\\n\\n== Middle years ==\\n\\n\\n=== Calculus ===\\n\\nNewton\\'s work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\". His work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton\\'s mathematical papers. His work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy). Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Leibniz\\'s notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.His work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\" and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"Because of this, the Principia has been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times and in Newton\\'s time \"nearly all of it is of this calculus.\" His use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in his De motu corporum in gyrum of 1684 and in his papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".\\n\\nNewton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism. He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton\\'s Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud; it was later found that Newton wrote the study\\'s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter\\'s death in 1716.Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton\\'s identities, Newton\\'s method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler\\'s summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton\\'s work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin\\'s decimals.When Newton received his MA and became a Fellow of the \"College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity\" in 1667, he made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7 years] arrives, or I will resign from the college.\" Up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirty-nine articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine.\\nHe was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669, on Barrow\\'s recommendation. During that time, any Fellow of a college at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church – presumably, so as to have more time for science. Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton\\'s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.\\n\\n\\n=== Optics ===\\n\\nIn 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.\\nFrom 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which he named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton\\'s analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.He showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton\\'s theory of colour.\\n\\nFrom this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton\\'s rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. In late 1668, he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton\\'s ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society\\'s correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke\\'s death.\\n\\nNewton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of \\'fits\\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today\\'s quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton\\'s understanding of light.\\nIn his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton\\'s writings on alchemy, stated that \"Newton was not the first of the age of reason: He was the last of the magicians.\" Newton\\'s interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science. This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity.\\nIn 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ... and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?\" Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.In his book Opticks, Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\\'s discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Young and Fresnel combined Newton\\'s particle theory with Huygens\\' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light\\'s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton\\'s armour, ... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.\"\\n\\n\\n=== Gravity ===\\n\\nIn 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler\\'s laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society\\'s correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton\\'s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society\\'s Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.\\nThe Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using \\'first and last ratios\\', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle\\'s law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth\\'s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon\\'s gravitational attraction on the Earth\\'s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.Newton made clear his heliocentric view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem\\'d the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\" (Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).Newton\\'s postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing \"occult agencies\" into science. Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (Here Newton used what became his famous expression \"hypotheses non-fingo\").\\nWith the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types.  In 1717, and probably with Newton\\'s help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.\\n\\n\\n== Later life ==\\n\\nIn the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed. He was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England\\'s great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously. He retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.\\nAs Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, however, Newton proved equal to the task.Disguised as a habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had himself made a justice of the peace in all the home counties. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton\\'s personal first edition of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which he must have been amending at the time. Then he conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.\\n\\nNewton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed\\'s Historia Coelestis Britannica, which Newton had used in his studies.In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton\\'s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint. Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon.As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty\\'s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.Newton was invested in the South Sea Company and lost some £20,000 (£4.4 million in 2020) when it collapsed in around 1720.Toward the end of his life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with his niece and her husband, until his death. His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduitt, served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her \"very loving Uncle\", according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nNewton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727). He was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens. He is also the first scientist to be buried in the abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton.After his death, Newton\\'s hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton\\'s eccentricity in late life.\\n\\n\\n== Personality and personal relations ==\\nAlthough it was claimed that he was once engaged, Newton never married. The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton\\'s funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments\". This now-widespread belief that he died a virgin has been commented on by writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan.Newton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around 1689—some of their correspondence has survived. Their relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown, which included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends Samuel Pepys and John Locke. His note to the latter included the charge that Locke \"endeavoured to embroil me with woemen\".Newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Two writers think that the sentence, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather than—or in addition to—a statement of modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert (a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College) in his Jacula Prudentum (1651), had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant\\'s shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the \\'dwarf\\'.\\nIn a later memoir, Newton wrote, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"In 2015, Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in physics, called Newton \"a nasty antagonist\" and \"a bad man to have as an enemy\". He particularly noted Newton\\'s attitude towards Robert Hooke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\\nIt has been suggested from these and other traits, and his profound power of concentration, that Newton may have had a form of high-functioning autism, known as Asperger\\'s syndrome.\\n\\n\\n== Legacy ==\\n\\n\\n=== Fame ===\\n\\nThe mathematician Joseph-Louis Lagrange said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that Newton was also \"the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish.\" English poet Alexander Pope wrote the famous epitaph:\\n\\nNature, and Nature\\'s laws lay hid in night.\\nGod said, Let Newton be! and all was light.\\nBut this was not allowed to be inscribed in the monument. The epitaph in the monument is as follows:\\nH. S. E. ISAACUS NEWTON Eques Auratus, / Qui, animi vi prope divinâ, / Planetarum Motus, Figuras, / Cometarum semitas, Oceanique Aestus. Suâ Mathesi facem praeferente / Primus demonstravit: / Radiorum Lucis dissimilitudines, / Colorumque inde nascentium proprietates, / Quas nemo antea vel suspicatus erat, pervestigavit. / Naturae, Antiquitatis, S.

MAR. MDCCXXVI,\\nwhich can be translated as follows:\\nHere is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25th December 1642, and died on 20th March 1726.\\nIn a 2005 survey of members of Britain\\'s Royal Society (formerly headed by Newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton or Albert Einstein, the members deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contribution. In 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of the day\\'s leading physicists voted Einstein the \"greatest physicist ever,\" with Newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists by the site PhysicsWeb gave the top spot to Newton. Einstein kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell.The SI derived unit of force is named the newton in his honour.\\nWoolsthorpe By Colsterworth is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through being his birthplace and  \"where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light\".In 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold for £730 (US$3,633) in London to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring. Guinness World Records 2002 classified it as the most valuable tooth, which would value approximately £25,000 (US$35,700) in late 2001. Who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed.\\n\\n\\n=== Apple incident ===\\n\\nNewton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree. The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton\\'s niece, to Voltaire. Voltaire then wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), \"Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.\"Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity at any single moment, acquaintances of Newton (such as William Stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton\\'s head. Stukeley recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton\\'s Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:\\nwe went into the garden, & drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he, & myself. amidst other discourse, he told me, he was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought he to him self: occasion\\'d by the fall of an apple, as he sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter. & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter; it must be in proportion of its quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"\\nJohn Conduitt, Newton\\'s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton\\'s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton\\'s life:\\nIn the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so, that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.\\n\\nIt is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon; however, it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon\\'s orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it \"universal gravitation\".\\nVarious trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The King\\'s School, Grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster\\'s garden some years later. The staff of the (now) National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale in Kent can supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.\\n\\n\\n=== Commemorations ===\\n\\nNewton\\'s monument (1731) can be seen in Westminster Abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. It was executed by the sculptor Michael Rysbrack (1694–1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent. The monument features a figure of Newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the Zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. A relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. The Latin inscription on the base translates as:Here is buried Isaac Newton, Knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. Diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy Scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of God mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the Gospel in his manners. Mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! He was born on 25 December 1642, and died on 20 March 1726/7.—Translation from G.L. Smyth, The Monuments and Genii of St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, and of Westminster Abbey (1826), ii, 703–704.\\nFrom 1978 until 1988, an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £1 banknotes issued by the Bank of England (the last £1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England). Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the Solar System.\\nA statue of Isaac Newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. A large bronze statue, Newton, after William Blake, by Eduardo Paolozzi, dated 1995 and inspired by Blake\\'s etching, dominates the piazza of the British Library in London. A bronze statue of Newton was erected in 1858 in the centre of Grantham where he went to school, prominently standing in front of Grantham Guildhall.\\nThe still-surviving farmhouse at Woolsthorpe By Colsterworth is a Grade I listed building by Historic England through being his birthplace and  \"where he discovered gravity and developed his theories regarding the refraction of light\".\\n\\n\\n== Theology ==\\n\\n\\n=== Religious views ===\\n\\nAlthough born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, with one historian labelling him a heretic.By 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined. They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early Church writings and show that in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined the Creed, he took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created him.\" He was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, \"the great apostasy was trinitarianism.\"Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.In Newton\\'s eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to him the fundamental sin. In 1999, historian Stephen D. Snobelen wrote, \"Isaac Newton was a heretic. But ... he never made a public declaration of his private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unraveling his personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.The view that Newton was Semi-Arian has lost support now that scholars have investigated Newton\\'s theological papers, and now most scholars identify Newton as an Antitrinitarian monotheist.\\n\\nAlthough the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power it could never put them into such a circulating motion, as they have about the sun\".Along with his scientific fame, Newton\\'s studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the Principia \"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\". He saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities. For this, Leibniz lampooned him: \"God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"Newton\\'s position was vigorously defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace\\'s work Celestial Mechanics had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention. The contrast between Laplace\\'s mechanistic worldview and Newton\\'s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave Napoleon, who had criticised him for the absence of the Creator in the Mécanique céleste: \"Sire, j\\'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse\" (\"Sir, I didn\\'t need this hypothesis\").Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the Trinity. His first biographer, David Brewster, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such. In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes (among others) were deciphered and it became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.\\n\\n\\n=== Religious thought ===\\nNewton and Robert Boyle\\'s approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, and at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton\\'s discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a \"Natural Religion\".\\nThe attacks made against pre-Enlightenment \"magical thinking\", and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle\\'s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle\\'s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.\\n\\n\\n=== The occult ===\\n\\nIn a manuscript he wrote in 1704 (never intended to be published), he mentions the date of 2060, but it is not given as a date for the end of days. It has been falsely reported as a prediction. The passage is clear when the date is read in context. He was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put Christianity into disrepute.\\n\\nSo then the time times & half a time  [sic] are 42 months or 1260 days or three years & an half, recconing twelve months to a year & 30 days to a month as was done in the Calender  [sic] of the primitive year. And the days of short lived Beasts being put for the years of [long-]lived kingdoms the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings A.C. 800, will end 2060. It may end later, but I see no reason for its ending sooner.\\nThis I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. Christ comes as a thief in the night, and it is not for us to know the times and seasons which God hath put into his own breast.\\n\\n\\n== Alchemy ==\\nIn the character of Morton Opperly in \"Poor Superman\" (1951), speculative fiction author Fritz Leiber says of Newton, \"Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist. Few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the philosopher\\'s stone. That was the pebble by the seashore he really wanted to find.\"Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton\\'s papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of Newton\\'s writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations. Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in Newton\\'s papers could have been considered heretical by the church.In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloguing Newton\\'s papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby\\'s. The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton\\'s collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.All of Newton\\'s known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University: \"The Chymistry of Isaac Newton\" and summarised in a book.\\nNewton\\'s fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life, although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton\\'s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"\\nCharles Coulston Gillispie disputes that Newton ever practised alchemy, saying that \"his chemistry was in the spirit of Boyle\\'s corpuscular philosophy.\"In June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton\\'s notes on Jan Baptist van Helmont\\'s book on plague, De Peste, were being auctioned online by Bonhams. Newton\\'s analysis of this book, which he made in Cambridge while protecting himself from London\\'s 1665–1666 infection, is the most substantial written statement he is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".\\n\\n\\n== The Enlightenment ==\\nEnlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.It is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton\\'s publication of the Principia was a turning point in the Scientific Revolution and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton\\'s conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton\\'s work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.\\n\\n\\n== Works ==\\n\\n\\n=== Published in his lifetime ===\\nDe analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas (1669, published 1711)\\nOf Natures Obvious Laws & Processes in Vegetation (unpublished, c. 1671–75)\\nDe motu corporum in gyrum (1684)\\nPhilosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687)\\nScala graduum Caloris.

              " 'Albert Einstein ( EYEN-styne; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (listen); 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\".In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (\\'miracle year\\'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.\\nHowever, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics, he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature \"does not play dice\". Second, he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.\\nEinstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg) the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for the rest of his life, and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; he also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.\\nIn 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government; he settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early life and education ===\\n\\nAlbert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. His parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the German Empire seven years later.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient alternating current (AC) standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, he traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor\\'s note. During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\".Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught himself algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"[Einstein] had worked through the whole book. He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\" His passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\".At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music), Einstein was introduced to Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: \"At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant\\'s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.\"\\n\\nIn 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH). He failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, he attended the Argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler\\'s daughter, Marie. Albert\\'s sister Maja later married Winteler\\'s son Paul. In January 1896, with his father\\'s approval, Einstein renounced his citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896 he passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.Einstein\\'s future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein\\'s and Marić\\'s friendship developed into a romance, and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra-curricular physics in which they were both interested. Einstein wrote in his letters to Marić that he preferred studying alongside her. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal teaching diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Marić might have collaborated with Einstein prior to his landmark 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions.\\n\\n\\n=== Marriages and children ===\\n\\nEarly correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named \"Lieserl\", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with her parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein\\'s letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with their sons after learning that, despite their close relationship before, Einstein\\'s chief romantic attraction was now his cousin Elsa Löwenthal; she was his first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić his future (in the event, 1921) Nobel Prize money.In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to his early love Marie Winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. He wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: \"I think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\" He spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding his love for Marie.Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with her since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. Elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach (a blonde Austrian), Estella Katzenellenbogen (the rich owner of a florist business), Toni Mendel (a wealthy Jewish widow) and Ethel Michanowski (a Berlin socialite), with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to Elsa. Later, after the death of his second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov (who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton).Einstein\\'s son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. His mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.\\n\\n\\n=== Patent office ===\\n\\nAfter graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann\\'s father, he secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III.Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, his position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\".Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.\\n\\nWith a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes they were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.\\n\\n\\n=== First scientific papers ===\\nIn 1900, Einstein\\'s paper \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\" (\"Conclusions from the Capillarity Phenomena\") was published in the journal Annalen der Physik. On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed his dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Zürich, serving as pro-forma advisor. His work was accepted in July, and Einstein was awarded a Ph.D.Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein\\'s annus mirabilis (amazing year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.\\n\\n\\n=== Academic career ===\\nBy 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.\\nIn July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany\\'s militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\".\\n\\nIn the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling him to concentrate exclusively on research. On 3 July 1913, he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited him the next week in Zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. He was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and he moved to Berlin the following year. His decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin Elsa, with whom he had started a romantic affair. Einstein assumed his position with the academy, and Berlin University, after moving into his Dahlem apartment on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. The institute was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as its director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society (1916–1918).In 1911, Einstein used his 1907 Equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun\\'s gravity. In 1913, Einstein improved upon those calculations by using Riemannian space-time to represent the gravity field. By the fall of 1915, Einstein had successfully completed his general theory of relativity, which he used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. In 1919, that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\".In 1920, he became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1921. He also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. Einstein\\'s scientific accomplishments while in Berlin, included finishing the general theory of relativity, proving the gyromagnetic effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and Bose–Einstein statistics.\\n\\n\\n=== 1921–1922: Travels abroad ===\\n\\nEinstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Sciences on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King\\'s College London.He also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\"In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. In his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to Asia, he expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.Because of Einstein\\'s travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In his place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days, his only visit to that region. He was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein\\'s talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming him a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.\\n\\nFrom 1922 to 1932, Einstein was a member of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations in Geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists, and intellectuals. Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have him become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist Catholic values. Einstein\\'s former physics professor Hendrik Lorentz and the Polish chemist Marie Curie were also members of the committee.\\n\\n\\n=== 1925: Visit to South America ===\\nIn the months of March and April 1925, Einstein visited South America, where he spent about a month in Argentina, a week in Uruguay, and a week in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Einstein\\'s visit was initiated by Jorge Duclout (1856–1927) and Mauricio Nirenstein (1877–1935) with the support of several Argentine scholars, including Julio Rey Pastor, Jakob Laub, and Leopoldo Lugones. The visit by Einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the Council of the University of Buenos Aires and the Asociación Hebraica Argentina (Argentine Hebraic Association) with a smaller contribution from the Argentine-Germanic Cultural Institution.\\n\\n\\n=== 1930–1931: Travel to the US ===\\nIn December 1930, Einstein visited America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the California Institute of Technology. After the national attention, he received during his first trip to the US, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to the city by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during his stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.\\n\\nEinstein next traveled to California, where he met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. His friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came his \"extraordinary intellectual energy\".Chaplin\\'s film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join him as his special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein\\'s biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". Chaplin visited Einstein at his home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled his \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. Chaplin speculated that it was \"possibly used as kindling wood by the Nazis\".\\n\\n\\n=== 1933: Emigration to the US ===\\n\\nIn February 1933, while on a visit to the United States, Einstein knew he could not return to Germany with the rise to power of the Nazis under Germany\\'s new chancellor, Adolf Hitler.While at American universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided his family\\'s apartment in Berlin. He and his wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, they learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler\\'s government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that they would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, they heard that their cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein\\'s personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his German citizenship. The Nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a Hitler Youth camp.\\n\\n\\n==== Refugee status ====\\n\\nIn April 1933, Einstein discovered that the new German government had passed laws barring Jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.A month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"... I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the US, he described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\".Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near his Cromer home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at his home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked them to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place them in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, they had lowered their \"technical standards\" and put the Allies\\' technology ahead of theirs.Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey\\'s Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom he wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches he denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech he described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK. Both bills failed, however, and Einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the Institute for Advanced Study, in Princeton, New Jersey, US, to become a resident scholar.\\n\\n\\n==== Resident scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study ====\\n\\nIn October 1933, Einstein returned to the US and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, as a result of their Jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.Einstein was still undecided on his future. He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.Einstein\\'s affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until his death in 1955. He was one of the four first selected (along with John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel) at the new Institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with Gödel. The two would take long walks together discussing their work. Bruria Kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.\\n\\n\\n==== World War II and the Manhattan Project ====\\n\\nIn 1939, a group of Hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist Leó Szilárd attempted to alert Washington to ongoing Nazi atomic bomb research. The group\\'s warnings were discounted. Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.\\nThe letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.\\nFor Einstein, \"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make them ...\" In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.\\n\\n\\n==== US citizenship ====\\n\\nEinstein became an American citizen in 1940. Not long after settling into his career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe. He recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what they pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. He considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\", seeing it as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\".\\n\\n\\n=== Personal life ===\\n\\n\\n==== Assisting Zionist causes ====\\n\\nEinstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which opened in 1925 and was among its first Board of Governors. Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. He also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.\\nAmong those, he advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.Einstein was not a nationalist; he was against the creation of an independent Jewish state, which would be established without his help as Israel in 1948. Einstein felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. His views were not shared by the majority of Jews seeking to form a new country; as a result, Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement.Chaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon his death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of its sons\". Einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was \"deeply moved\", and \"at once saddened and ashamed\" that he could not accept it.\\n\\n\\n==== Love of music ====\\n\\nEinstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. In his late journals he wrote: \"If I were not a physicist, I would probably be a musician. I often think in music. I live my daydreams in music. I see my life in terms of music... I get most joy in life out of music.\"His mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into German culture. According to conductor Leon Botstein, Einstein began playing when he was 5. However, he did not enjoy it at that age.When he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon he became enamored of Mozart\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". He said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\" At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart\\'s work; that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart\\'s works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein\\'s level of coordination and intonation\".\\n\\n\\n==== Political views ====\\n\\nIn 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the German Democratic Party, a liberal party. Later in his life, Einstein\\'s political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as \"Why Socialism?\" His opinions on the Bolsheviks also changed with time. In 1925, he criticized them for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called their rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. He later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing their methods but praising them, which is shown by his 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice. I do not find his methods advisable. One thing is certain, however: men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankind\\'s conscience.\" Einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. He strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. He wrote \"I advocate world government because I am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself.\" The FBI created a secret dossier on Einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his FBI file was 1,427 pages long.Einstein was deeply impressed by Mahatma Gandhi, with whom he exchanged written letters. He described Gandhi as \"a role model for the generations to come\". The initial connection was established on 27 September 1931, when Wilfrid Israel took his Indian guest V. A. Sundaram to meet his friend Einstein at his summer home in the town of Caputh. Sundaram was Gandhi\\'s disciple and special envoy, whom Wilfrid Israel met while visiting India and visiting the Indian leader\\'s home in 1925. During the visit, Einstein wrote a short letter to Gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy, and Gandhi responded quickly with his own letter. Although in the end Einstein and Gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped, the direct connection between them was established through Wilfrid Israel.\\n\\n\\n==== Religious and philosophical views ====\\n\\nEinstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. He said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic God of Baruch Spinoza\\'s philosophy. He did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naïve. He clarified, however, that \"I am not an atheist\", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a \"deeply religious nonbeliever\". When asked if he believed in an afterlife, Einstein replied, \"No. And one life is enough for me.\"Einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and Ethical Culture groups in both the UK and US. He served on the advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York, and was an honorary associate of the Rationalist Association, which publishes New Humanist in Britain. For the 75th anniversary of the New York Society for Ethical Culture, he stated that the idea of Ethical Culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. He observed, \"Without \\'ethical culture\\' there is no salvation for humanity.\"\\nIn a German-language letter to philosopher Eric Gutkind, dated 3 January 1954, Einstein wrote:The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honorable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions. And the Jewish people to whom I gladly belong and with whose mentality I have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people. ... I cannot see anything \\'chosen\\' about them.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nOn 17 April 1955, Einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by Rudolph Nissen in 1948. He took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of Israel\\'s seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live to complete it.Einstein refused surgery, saying, \"I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.\" He died in the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.During the autopsy, the pathologist Thomas Stoltz Harvey removed Einstein\\'s brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein\\'s remains were cremated in Trenton, New Jersey, and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.In a memorial lecture delivered on 13 December 1965 at UNESCO headquarters, nuclear physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer summarized his impression of Einstein as a person: \"He was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness ... There was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.\"Einstein bequeathed his personal archives, library and intellectual assets to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel.\\n\\n\\n== Scientific career ==\\nThroughout his life, Einstein published hundreds of books and articles. He published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. On 5 December 2014, universities and archives announced the release of Einstein\\'s papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. Einstein\\'s intellectual achievements and originality have made the word \"Einstein\" synonymous with \"genius\". In addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the Bose–Einstein statistics, the Einstein refrigerator and others.\\n\\n\\n=== 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers ===\\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. These four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. The four papers are:\\n\\n\\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\\n\\n\\n==== Thermodynamic fluctuations and statistical physics ====\\n\\nEinstein\\'s first paper submitted in 1900 to Annalen der Physik was on capillary attraction. It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902–1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.\\n\\n\\n==== Theory of critical opalescence ====\\n\\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\\n\\n\\n=== Special relativity ===\\n\\nEinstein\\'s \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciled conflicts between Maxwell\\'s equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). The theory developed in this paper later became known as Einstein\\'s special theory of relativity. There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with his first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E = mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). In 1908, Hermann Minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. Einstein adopted Minkowski\\'s formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.\\n\\n\\n=== General relativity ===\\n\\n\\n==== General relativity and the equivalence principle ====\\n\\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.In 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.\\n\\n\\n==== Gravitational waves ====\\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.\\nThe first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein\\'s prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.\\n\\n\\n==== Hole argument and Entwurf theory ====\\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\\'draft\\') theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\\n\\n\\n==== Physical cosmology ====\\n\\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of Mach\\'s principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein\\'s static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel\\'s [sic] facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"\\nIt thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.\\n\\n\\n==== Energy momentum pseudotensor ====\\n\\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether\\'s theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether\\'s prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\\nEinstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.\\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others.\\n\\n\\n==== Wormholes ====\\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with Nathan Rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called Einstein–Rosen bridges. His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted Schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.If one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\\n\\n\\n==== Einstein–Cartan theory ====\\n\\nIn order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\\n\\n\\n==== Equations of motion ====\\n\\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law—the Einstein field equations, which describe how space curves. The geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the Einstein field equations.\\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.\\n\\n\\n=== Old quantum theory ===\\n\\n\\n==== Photons and energy quanta ====\\n\\nIn a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein\\'s light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan\\'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of Compton scattering.\\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each, where h is Planck\\'s constant. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.\\n\\n\\n==== Quantized atomic vibrations ====\\n\\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. Peter Debye refined this model.\\n\\n\\n==== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ====\\n\\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.\\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.\\n\\n\\n==== Bose–Einstein statistics ====\\n\\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a statistical model from Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose\\'s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose\\'s paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the NIST–JILA laboratory at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Bose–Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. Einstein\\'s sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.\\n\\n\\n==== Wave–particle duality ====\\n\\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Bern. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck\\'s energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. This paper introduced the photon concept (although the name photon was introduced later by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\\n\\n\\n==== Zero-point energy ====\\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant Otto Stern. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.\\n\\n\\n==== Stimulated emission ====\\nIn 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in Physikalische Zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.\\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck\\'s distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\\n\\n\\n==== Matter waves ====\\nEinstein discovered Louis de Broglie\\'s work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for de Broglie waves, which Einstein suggested was the Hamilton–Jacobi equation of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schrödinger\\'s work of 1926.\\n\\n\\n=== Quantum mechanics ===\\n\\n\\n==== Einstein\\'s objections to quantum mechanics ====\\n\\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. However, he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925, despite its acceptance by other physicists. He was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism, stating that God \"is not playing at dice\". Until the end of his life, he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete.\\n\\n\\n==== Bohr versus Einstein ====\\n\\n The Bohr–Einstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between Einstein and Niels Bohr, who were two of its founders. Their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. Their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.\\n\\n\\n==== Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox ====\\n\\nIn 1935, Einstein returned to quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the \"EPR paper\". In a thought experiment, he considered two particles, which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.Given Einstein\\'s concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\").Einstein\\'s belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell\\'s theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.\"Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.\\n\\n\\n=== Unified field theory ===\\n\\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"unified field theory\" in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". Although he was lauded for this work, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\\nNotably, Einstein\\'s unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which were well understood until many years after his death. Although mainstream physics long ignored Einstein\\'s approaches to unification, Einstein\\'s work has motivated modern quests for a theory of everything, in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\\n\\n\\n=== Other investigations ===\\n\\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.\\n\\n\\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\\n\\nIn addition to longtime collaborators Leopold Infeld, Nathan Rosen, Peter Bergmann and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\\n\\n\\n==== Einstein–de Haas experiment ====\\n\\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron\\'s angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\\n\\n\\n==== Schrödinger gas model ====\\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a Bose–Einstein gas by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.This formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. Schrödinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.\\n\\n\\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Leó Szilárd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the Einstein refrigerator. This absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. On 11 November 1930, U.S. Patent 1,781,541 was awarded to Einstein and Leó Szilárd for the refrigerator. Their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the Swedish company Electrolux.\\n\\n\\n== Non-scientific legacy ==\\n\\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Margot Einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). Barbara Wolff, of the Hebrew University\\'s Albert Einstein Archives, told the BBC that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.Einstein\\'s right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in California. Although the court initially held that the right had expired, that ruling was immediately appealed, and the decision was later vacated in its entirety. The underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled. The right is enforceable, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right. Corbis, successor to The Roger Richman Agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.\\n\\n\\n== In popular culture ==\\n\\nEinstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities, beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919. Despite the general public having little understanding of his work, he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity. In the period before World War II, The New Yorker published a vignette in their \"The Talk of the Town\" feature saying that Einstein was so well known in America that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain \"that theory\". He finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. He told his inquirers \"Pardon me, sorry! Always I am mistaken for Professor Einstein.\"Einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. He is a favorite model for depictions of absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. Time magazine\\'s Frederic Golden wrote that Einstein was \"a cartoonist\\'s dream come true\".Many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.\\n\\n\\n== Awards and honors ==\\n\\nEinstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.\\n\\n\\n== Publications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Scientific ===\\n\\n\\n=== Others ===\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== Notes ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n=== Works cited ===\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\n\\nAlbert Einstein at Curlie\\nWorks by Albert Einstein at Project Gutenberg\\nWorks by or about Albert Einstein at Internet Archive\\nWorks by Albert Einstein at LibriVox (public domain audiobooks) \\nEinstein\\'s Personal Correspondence: Religion, Politics, The Holocaust, and Philosophy Shapell Manuscript Foundation\\nFederal Bureau of Investigation file on Albert Einstein\\nEinstein and his love of music, Physics World\\nAlbert Einstein on Nobelprize.org  including the Nobel Lecture 11 July 1923 Fundamental ideas and problems of the theory of relativity\\nAlbert Einstein Archives Online (80,000+ Documents) Archived 11 August 2011 at WebCite (MSNBC, 19 March 2012)\\nEinstein\\'s declaration of intention for American citizenship on the World Digital Library\\nAlbert Einstein Collection at Brandeis University\\nThe Collected Papers of Albert Einstein \"Digital Einstein\" at Princeton University\\nNewspaper clippings about Albert Einstein in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW\\nHome page of Albert Einstein at The Institute for Advanced Study\\nAlbert – The Digital Repository of the IAS, which contains many digitized original documents and photographs',\n",
              " 'Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory.Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career, he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world\\'s first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children. He died in 1931 of complications of diabetes.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nThomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. He was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born in Chenango County, New York). His patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been \"Edeson\". His grandfather John Edeson fled New Jersey for Nova Scotia in 1784, his father moved to Vienna, Ontario and fled after his involvement in the Rebellion of 1837.Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, who used to be a school teacher. He attended school for only a few months. However, one biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things by reading on his own. As a child, he became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of his deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. He subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of his deafness. As he was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping his teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into his skull. As he got older, Edison believed his hearing loss allowed him to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on his work. Modern-day historians and medical professionals have suggested he may have had ADHD.It is known that early in his career he enrolled in a chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, to support his work on a new telegraphy system with Charles Batchelor. This appears to have been his only enrollment in courses at an institution of higher learning.\\n\\n\\n== Early career ==\\nThomas Edison began his career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments. He became a telegraph operator after he saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie\\'s father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that he trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison\\'s first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway. He was held responsible for a near collision. He also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until he left the job.Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, he set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which he sold with his other papers. This began Edison\\'s long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as he discovered his talents as a businessman. Ultimately, his entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with a lead–acid battery when he spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran between the floorboards and onto his boss\\'s desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.His first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869. Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of his mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of his Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded their own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.\\n\\n\\n== Menlo Park laboratory (1876–1886) ==\\n\\n\\n=== Research and development facility ===\\n\\nEdison\\'s major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township (now named Edison Township in his honor) in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison\\'s quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union to make a bid. He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($228,700 in today\\'s dollars), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison\\'s first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.\\nWilliam Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. He assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device (see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps). In 1880, he was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\". Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague\\'s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison\\'s mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that he was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm\\'s Law, Joule\\'s Law and economics.Nearly all of Edison\\'s patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions he described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.In just over a decade, Edison\\'s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said he wanted the lab to have \"a stock of almost every conceivable material\". A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of his claim, stating the lab contained \"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark\\'s teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock\\'s tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...\" and the list goes on.Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds\\' famous quotation: \"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\" This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.\\nIn Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling its application. Edison\\'s name is registered on 1,093 patents.\\n\\n\\n=== Phonograph ===\\n\\nEdison began his career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and his other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained him wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\".His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite its limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \"the most ingenious inventor in this country... or in any other\". In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes. The Washington Post described Edison as a \"genius\" and his presentation as \"a scene... that will live in history\". Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, he did little to develop it until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.\\n\\n\\n=== Carbon telephone transmitter ===\\nIn 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones (at that time called a \"transmitter\") by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.\\nUp to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it. His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner\\'s loose-contact carbon transmitter (who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitter\\'s invention) and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters (work that Hughes did not bother to patent).Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union. In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with his discovery that it worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.\\n\\n\\n=== Electric light ===\\n\\nIn 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb. In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success. Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta\\'s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel.\\nThese early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.:\\u200a217–218\\u200a In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. He then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament. Edison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 (granted on January 27, 1880) for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\".The patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\". It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200 hours.\\n\\nIn 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of his incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that he said: \"We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\"\\n\\nHenry Villard, president of the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company, attended Edison\\'s 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install his electric lighting system aboard Villard\\'s company\\'s new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard\\'s request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia\\'s new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison\\'s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.In 1880, Lewis Latimer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation, began working for the United States Electric Lighting Company run by Edison\\'s rival Hiram S. Maxim. While working for Maxim, Latimer invented a process for making carbon filaments for light bulbs and helped install broad-scale lighting systems for New York City, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London. Latimer holds the patent for the electric lamp issued in 1881, and a second patent for the “process of manufacturing carbons” (the filament used in incandescent light bulbs), issued in 1882.\\nOn October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison\\'s patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years. In 1885, Latimer switched camps and started working with Edison. On October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison\\'s electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid. To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison\\'s, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.\\nThe incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well. Mahen Theatre in Brno (in what is now the Czech Republic), opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison\\'s electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison\\'s assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation. In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre. The first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson\\'s textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882.\\n\\n\\n=== Electric power distribution ===\\nAfter devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \"utility\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities. On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. The company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on his Pearl Street generating station\\'s electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current (DC) to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.In January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. The DC supply system provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.\\n\\n\\n=== War of currents ===\\n\\nAs Edison expanded his direct current (DC) power delivery system, he received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current (AC) systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" (reduce) the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison\\'s patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply. Edison\\'s DC empire suffered from one of its chief drawbacks: it was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison\\'s DC plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.\\nEdison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against his chief rival stating, \"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size. He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.\" Many reasons have been suggested for Edison\\'s anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system he did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based their design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after they had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison\\'s mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison\\'s 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company of Lynn, Massachusetts (another AC-based competitor) built 22 power stations.Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used it. Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages (to the point of making it an ineffective power delivery system) in what was now being referred to as a \"battle of currents\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse\\'s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\\nThomas Edison\\'s staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with his own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison\\'s company was generating much smaller profits than its AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.\\n\\n\\n== West Orange and Fort Myers (1886–1931) ==\\n\\nEdison moved from Menlo Park after the death of his first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \"Glenmont\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for his second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 (equivalent to $79,210 in 2020) and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture. The building materials were pre-cut in New England by the Kennebec Framing Company and the Stephen Nye Lumber Company of Fairfield Maine. The materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings. Edison and Mina spent many winters at their home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.Due to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.Edison became concerned with America\\'s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.  Edison\\'s work on rubber took place largely at his research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project, while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to his West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after it was dried and crushed to a powder. After testing 17,000 plant samples, he eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth\\'s Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.During the 1911 New York Electrical show, Edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame he didn\\'t have a \"chunk of it\". The representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with their gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for his part in the \"continuous stimulation in the copper industry\".\\n\\n\\n== Other inventions and projects ==\\n\\n\\n=== Fluoroscopy ===\\nEdison is credited with designing and producing the first commercially available fluoroscope, a machine that uses X-rays to take radiographs. Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.\\nThe fundamental design of Edison\\'s fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made himself an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation; he later died (at the age of 39) of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \"Don\\'t talk to me about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\" Nonetheless, his work was important in the development of a technology still used today.\\n\\n\\n=== Tasimeter ===\\nEdison invented a highly sensitive device, that he named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation.  His impetus for its creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878. The device was not patented since Edison could find no practical mass-market application for it.\\n\\n\\n=== Telegraph improvements ===\\nThe key to Edison\\'s initial reputation and success was his work in the field of telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, he learned the basics of electricity. This, together with his studies in chemistry at the Cooper Union, allowed him to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. His innovations also included the development of the quadruplex, the first system which could simultaneously transmit four messages through a single wire.\\n\\n\\n=== Motion pictures ===\\n\\nEdison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, labeled the \"Kinetograph\". He did the electromechanical design while his employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.In April 1896, Thomas Armat\\'s Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison\\'s name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, he exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.\\nOfficially the kinetoscope entered Europe when wealthy American businessman Irving T. Bush (1869–1948) bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe (i.e. the Netherlands and Italy). In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck & Co of Cologne.\\nThe first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison\\'s Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in this company were Belgian industrialists.On May 14, 1895, the Edison\\'s Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, he also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.Edison\\'s film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott\\'s Sneeze (1894), The Kiss (1896), The Great Train Robbery (1903), Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland (1910), and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced they would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution (with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant), Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film it, releasing it that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.\\n\\nAs the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other\\'s films. To better protect the copyrights on his films, Edison deposited prints of them on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.In 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios (commonly known as the Edison Trust). Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.\\nEdison said his favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. He thought that talkies had \"spoiled everything\" for him. \"There isn\\'t any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\" His favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.\\n\\n\\n=== Mining ===\\nStarting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. He returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. His attempts to mine the ore body were not successful, and he abandoned his mining claim in 1903. A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for him.\\n\\n\\n=== Rechargeable battery ===\\n\\nIn the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery (at that time called an \"accumulator\"). He looked on them as something customers could use to power their phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles. The then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid. He had his lab work on many types of materials (going through some 10,000 combinations), eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides his experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel–iron battery by the Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner.Edison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company, and by 1904 it had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries they produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects, with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of the company was exhausted, Edison paid for the company with his private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel–iron battery was never very successful; by the time it was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for turning over gas-powered car starter motors.\\n\\n\\n=== Chemicals ===\\nAt the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records—presumably as phenolic resins of the Bakelite type.\\nAt the time, phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting.  Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells.  A telling of the phenol story is found in The Aspirin Wars. Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate.  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.\\nEdison responded by undertaking production of phenol at his Silver Lake facility using processes developed by his chemists. He built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  He built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust.  Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax.  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.\\nPhenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. Bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. Aspirin, too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899, it had become a block buster drug. Bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in Rensselaer, New York, but struggled to find phenol to keep their plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.\\nBayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in Piscataway, New Jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which they converted to aspirin.  (See Great Phenol plot.) It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate.  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  He sold his surplus to Bayer, who had it converted to salicylic acid by Heyden, some of which was exported.\\n\\n\\n=== Spirit Phone ===\\nIn 1920, Edison spoke to American Magazine, saying that he had been working on a device for some time to see if it was possible to communicate with the dead. Edison said the device would work on scientific principles not by an occult means. The announcement caused a press heyday, though the actual nature of this invention remained a mystery, as there were no details for some time. Until In 2015, Philippe Baudouin, a French journalist, found a copy of Edison\\'s Diary in a thrift store with a chapter not found in the previously published editions. The new chapter details Edison\\'s theories of the afterlife and the scientific basis by which communication  with them might be achieved.\\n\\n\\n== Final years and death ==\\n\\n\\n=== Final years ===\\n\\nHenry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford\\'s internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until Edison\\'s death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated.\\nIn 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks.\" He was an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club\\'s meetings.\\nEdison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before his death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite his frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU (Multiple-Unit) train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on its way to South Orange.This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until their retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison\\'s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in his last few years; \"the only liquid he consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\". He is reported to have believed this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him, \"Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies.\" She also said that during one of his periodic \"great scientific adventures\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that he continued to have all three.Edison became the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in 1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps and candles.\\n\\n\\n=== Death ===\\nEdison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home, \"Glenmont\" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben officiated at the funeral; Edison is buried behind the home.Edison\\'s last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal a test tube of air in the inventor\\'s room shortly after his death, as a memento. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison\\'s hands were also made. Mina died in 1947.\\n\\n\\n== Marriages and children ==\\nOn December 25, 1871, at the age of 24, Edison married 16-year-old Mary Stilwell (1855–1884), whom he had met two months earlier; she was an employee at one of his shops. They had three children:\\n\\nMarion Estelle Edison (1873–1965), nicknamed \"Dot\"\\nThomas Alva Edison Jr. (1876–1935), nicknamed \"Dash\"\\nWilliam Leslie Edison (1878–1937) Inventor, graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 1900.Mary Edison died at age 29 on August 9, 1884, of unknown causes: possibly from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose. Doctors frequently prescribed morphine to women in those years to treat a variety of causes, and researchers believe that her symptoms could have been from morphine poisoning.Edison generally preferred spending time in the laboratory to being with his family.\\n\\nOn February 24, 1886, at the age of 39, Edison married the 20-year-old Mina Miller (1865–1947) in Akron, Ohio. She was the daughter of the inventor Lewis Miller, co-founder of the Chautauqua Institution, and a benefactor of Methodist charities. They also had three children together:\\n\\nMadeleine Edison (1888–1979), who married John Eyre Sloane.\\nCharles Edison (1890–1969), Governor of New Jersey (1941–1944), who took over his father\\'s company and experimental laboratories upon his father\\'s death.\\nTheodore Miller Edison (1898–1992), (MIT Physics 1923), credited with more than 80 patents.Mina outlived Thomas Edison, dying on August 24, 1947.Wanting to be an inventor, but not having much of an aptitude for it, Thomas Edison\\'s son, Thomas Alva Edison Jr., became a problem for his father and his father\\'s business. Starting in the 1890s, Thomas Jr. became involved in snake oil products and shady and fraudulent enterprises producing products being sold to the public as \"The Latest Edison Discovery\". The situation became so bad that Thomas Sr. had to take his son to court to stop the practices, finally agreeing to pay Thomas Jr. an allowance of $35 (equivalent to $1,008 in 2020) per week, in exchange for not using the Edison name; the son began using aliases, such as Burton Willard. Thomas Jr., suffering from alcoholism, depression and ill health, worked at several menial jobs, but by 1931 (towards the end of his life) he would obtain a role in the Edison company, thanks to the intervention of his half-brother Charles.\\n\\n\\n== Views ==\\n\\n\\n=== On religion, and metaphysics ===\\n\\nHistorian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a \"freethinker\". Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine\\'s The Age of Reason. Edison defended Paine\\'s \"scientific deism\", saying, \"He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.\" In 1878, Edison joined the Theosophical Society in New Jersey, but according to its founder, H. P. Blavatsky, he was not a very active member. In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated:\\n\\nNature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me—the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love—He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us—nature did it all—not the gods of the religions.\\n\\nEdison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter:\\n\\nYou have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.\\nHe also stated, \"I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.\" In 1920, Edison set off a media sensation when he told B. C. Forbes of American Magazine that he was working on a \"spirit phone\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated. Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \"I really had nothing to tell him, but I hated to disappoint him so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\"\\n\\n\\n=== On politics ===\\nEdison was a supporter of women\\'s suffrage. He said in 1915, \"Every woman in this country is going to have the vote.\" Edison notably signed onto a statement supporting women\\'s suffrage which was published to counter anti-suffragist literature spread by Senator James Edgar Martine.Nonviolence was key to Edison\\'s political and moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, he specified he would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\" Edison\\'s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which he stated: \"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\" He was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of his life. Following a tour of Europe in 1911, Edison spoke negatively about \"the belligerent nationalism that he had sensed in every country he visited”.Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. He was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, he was quoted in the New York Times as stating: \"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\" In the same article, he expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. Edison argued that, if the government can produce debt-based money, it could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\". In it, he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities they produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about his desire for monetary reform. For insight, he corresponded with prominent academic and banking professionals. In the end, however, Edison\\'s proposals failed to find support and were abandoned.\\n\\n\\n== Awards ==\\nThe following is an incomplete list of awards given to Edison during his lifetime and posthumously:\\nIn 1878, Edison was awarded an honorary PhD from Union College\\nThe President of the Third French Republic, Jules Grévy, on the recommendation of his Minister of Foreign Affairs, Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire, and with the presentations of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, Louis Cochery, designated Edison with the distinction of an Officer of the Legion of Honour (Légion d\\'honneur) by decree on November 10, 1881; Edison was also named a Chevalier in the Legion in 1879, and a Commander in 1889.\\nIn 1887, Edison won the Matteucci Medal.

In the 2005 television series The Greatest American, he was voted by viewers as the fifteenth greatest.\\nIn 2008, Edison was inducted in the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\nIn 2010, Edison was honored with a Technical Grammy Award.\\nIn 2011, Edison was inducted into the Entrepreneur Walk of Fame and named a Great Floridian by the governor and cabinet of Florida.\\n\\n\\n== Tributes ==\\n\\n\\n=== Places and people named for Edison ===\\n\\nSeveral places have been named after Edison, most notably the town of Edison, New Jersey. Thomas Edison State University, nationally known for adult learners, is in Trenton, New Jersey. Two community colleges are named for him: Edison State College (now Florida SouthWestern State College) in Fort Myers, Florida, and\\nEdison Community College in Piqua, Ohio. There are numerous high schools named after Edison (see Edison High School) and other schools including Thomas A. Edison Middle School. Footballer Pelé\\'s father originally named him Edison, as a tribute to the inventor of the light bulb, but the name was incorrectly listed on his birth certificate as \"Edson\".The small town of Alva just east of Fort Myers took Edison\\'s middle name.\\nIn 1883, the City Hotel in Sunbury, Pennsylvania was the first building to be lit with Edison\\'s three-wire system. The hotel was renamed The Hotel Edison upon Edison\\'s return to the city on 1922.In 1954, Lake Thomas A Edison in California was named after Edison to mark the 75th anniversary of the incandescent light bulb.Edison was on hand to turn on the lights at the Hotel Edison in New York City when it opened in 1931.Three bridges around the United States have been named in Edison\\'s honor: the Edison Bridge in New Jersey, the Edison Bridge in Florida, and the Edison Bridge in Ohio.In space, his name is commemorated in asteroid 742 Edisona.\\nMount Edison in the Chugach Mountains of Alaska was named after him in 1955.\\n\\n\\n=== Museums and memorials ===\\n\\nIn West Orange, New Jersey, the 13.5 acres (5.5 hectares) Glenmont estate is maintained and operated by the National Park Service as the Edison National Historic Site, as is his nearby laboratory and workshops including the reconstructed \"Black Maria\"—the world\\'s first movie studio. The Thomas Alva Edison Memorial Tower and Museum is in the town of Edison, New Jersey. In Beaumont, Texas, there is an Edison Museum, though Edison never visited there.\\nThe Port Huron Museum, in Port Huron, Michigan, restored the original depot that Thomas Edison worked out of as a young news butcher. The depot has been named the Thomas Edison Depot Museum. The town has many Edison historical landmarks, including the graves of Edison\\'s parents, and a monument along the St. Clair River. Edison\\'s influence can be seen throughout this city of 32,000.\\nIn Detroit, the Edison Memorial Fountain in Grand Circus Park was created to honor his achievements. The limestone fountain was dedicated October 21, 1929, the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the light bulb. On the same night, The Edison Institute was dedicated in nearby Dearborn.\\nHe was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1969.Henry Ford had Edison\\'s name inscribed over the main doorway of the Ford Engineering Laboratory.\\nA bronze statue of Edison was placed in the National Statuary Hall Collection at the United States Capitol in 2016, with the formal dedication ceremony held on September 20 of that year. The Edison statue replaced one of 19th-century state governor William Allen that had been one of Ohio\\'s two allowed contributions to the collection.\\n\\n\\n=== Companies bearing Edison\\'s name ===\\n\\nEdison General Electric, merged with Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric\\nCommonwealth Edison, now part of Exelon\\nConsolidated Edison\\nEdison International\\nDetroit Edison, a unit of DTE Energy\\nEdison S.p.A., a unit of Italenergia\\nTrade association the Edison Electric Institute, a lobbying and research group for investor-owned utilities in the United States\\nEdison Ore-Milling Company\\nEdison Portland Cement Company\\nOhio Edison (merged with Centerior in 1997 to form First Energy)\\nSouthern California Edison\\n\\n\\n=== Awards named in honor of Edison ===\\nThe Edison Medal was created on February 11, 1904, by a group of Edison\\'s friends and associates. Four years later the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), later IEEE, entered into an agreement with the group to present the medal as its highest award. The first medal was presented in 1909 to Elihu Thomson. It is the oldest award in the area of electrical and electronics engineering, and is presented annually \"for a career of meritorious achievement in electrical science, electrical engineering or the electrical arts\".\\nIn the Netherlands, the major music awards are named the Edison Award after him. The award is an annual Dutch music prize, awarded for outstanding achievements in the music industry, and is one of the oldest music awards in the world, having been presented since 1960.\\nThe American Society of Mechanical Engineers has awarded the Thomas A. Edison Patent Award since 1997 to individual patents that demonstrate a significant impact on the practice of mechanical engineering.\\n\\n\\n=== Other items named after Edison ===\\nThe United States Navy named the USS Edison (DD-439), a Gleaves class destroyer, in his honor in 1940. The ship was decommissioned a few months after the end of World War II. In 1962, the Navy commissioned USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610), a fleet ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.\\n\\n\\n=== In popular culture ===\\n\\nThomas Edison has appeared in popular culture as a character in novels, films, comics and video games. His prolific inventing helped make him an icon and he has made appearances in popular culture during his lifetime down to the present day. Edison is also portrayed in popular culture as an adversary of Nikola Tesla.On February 11, 2011, on what would have been Thomas Edison\\'s 164th birthday, Google\\'s homepage featured an animated Google Doodle commemorating his many inventions. When the cursor was hovered over the doodle, a series of mechanisms seemed to move, causing a light bulb to glow.\\n\\n\\n== People who worked for Edison ==\\nThe following is a list of people who worked for Thomas Edison in his laboratories at Menlo Park or West Orange or at the subsidiary electrical businesses that he supervised.\\n\\nEdward Goodrich Acheson – chemist, worked at Menlo Park 1880–1884\\nWilliam Symes Andrews – started at the Menlo Park machine shop 1879\\nCharles Batchelor – \"chief experimental assistant\"\\nJohn I.

              "[\"Nikola Tesla  TESS-lə Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла, pronounced nǐkola têsla 10 July O.S. 28 June 1856 – 7 January 1943 was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current AC electricity supply system.Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. he worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on he own. With the help of partners to finance and market he ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. he alternating current AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned he a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which Tesla eventually marketed.Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillatorsgenerators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. he also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated he achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at he lab, and was noted for he showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued he ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in he high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with he devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in he unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete Tesla.After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of he money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. he died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following he death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in he honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.\",\n",
              " \"Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire present day Croatia, on 10 July O.S. 28 June 1856. Nikola Tesla father, Milutin Tesla 1819–1879, was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Tesla's mother, Đuka Mandić 1822–1892, whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited Đuka eidetic memory and creative abilities to Đuka mother's genetics and influence. Tesla's progenitors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.Tesla was the fourth of five children. Nikola Tesla had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier.\",\n",
              " 'Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by he physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this \"mysterious phenomena\" made he want \"to know more of this wonderful force\". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in he head, which prompted he teachers to believe that he was cheating. he finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.After graduating Tesla returned to Smiljan but soon contracted cholera, was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. In a moment of despair, Tesla\\'s father who had originally wanted he to enter the priesthood, promised to send he to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness.The next year Tesla evaded conscription into the Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter\\'s garb. Tesla said that this contact with nature made he stronger, both physically and mentally. he read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain\\'s works had helped he to miraculously recover from he earlier illness.he enrolled at the Imperial-Royal Technical College in Graz in 1875 on a Military Frontier scholarship. In he autobiography Tesla said he worked hard and earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams nearly twice as many as required and received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to he father, which stated, \"Your son is a star of first rank.\" At Graz, Tesla noted he fascination with the detailed lectures on electricity presented by Professor Jakob Pöschl and described how he made suggestions on improving the design of an electric motor the professor was demonstrating. But by he third year he was failing in school and never graduated, leaving Graz in December 1878. One biographer suggests Tesla wasn\\'t studying and may have been expelled for gambling and womanizing.',\n",
              " \"Tesla's family did not hear from Tesla after Tesla left school. There was a rumor amongst Tesla classmates that Tesla had drowned in the nearby Mur River but in January one of Tesla's family ran into Tesla in the town of Maribor across the border in Slovenia and reported that encounter to Tesla's family. It turned out Tesla had been working there as a draftsman for 60 florins per month. In March 1879, Milutin finally located Milutin son and tried to convince his son to return home and take up his education in Prague. Tesla returned to Gospić later that month when his son was deported for not having a residence permit. Tesla's father died the next month, on 17 April 1879, at the age of 60 after an unspecified illness. During the rest of the year Tesla taught a large class of students in his old school in Gospić.In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help his son leave Gospić for Prague, where his son was to study. his son arrived too late to enroll at Charles-Ferdinand University his son had never studied Greek, a required subject and his son was illiterate in Czech, another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures in philosophy at Charles-Ferdinand University as an auditor but his son did not receive grades for the courses.\",\n",
              " ' Working at Budapest Telephone Exchange Tesla moved to Budapest, Hungary, in 1881 to work under Tivadar Puskás at a telegraph company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so Tesla worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional, and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position. During Tesla employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone repeater or amplifier, which was never patented nor publicly described.',\n",
              " ' Working at Edison In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla another job in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in what was then a brand new industry, installing indoor incandescent lighting citywide in large scale electric power utility. Tesla had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There Tesla gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of Tesla advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had Tesla designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent Tesla on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.',\n",
              " 'In 1884, Edison manager Charles Batchelor, who had been overseeing the Paris installation, was brought back to the United States to manage the Edison Machine Works, a manufacturing division situated in New York City, and asked that Tesla be brought to the United States as well. In June 1884, Tesla emigrated and began working almost immediately at the Machine Works on Manhattan\\'s Lower East Side, an overcrowded shop with a workforce of several hundred machinists, laborers, managing staff, and 20 \"field engineers\" struggling with the task of building the large electric utility in New York City. As in Paris, Tesla was working on troubleshooting installations and improving generators. Historian W. Bernard Carlson notes Tesla may have met company founder Thomas Edison only a couple of times. One of those times was noted in Tesla\\'s autobiography where, after staying up all night repairing the damaged dynamos on the ocean liner SS Oregon, Historian W. Bernard Carlson ran into Batchelor and Edison, who made a quip about their \"Parisian\" being out all night. After Tesla told their Historian W. Bernard Carlson had been up all night fixing the Oregon, Edison commented to Batchelor that \"this is a damned good man\". One of the projects given to Tesla was to develop an arc lamp-based street lighting system. Arc lighting was the most popular type of street lighting but Arc lighting required high voltages and was incompatible with the Edison low-voltage incandescent system, causing Tesla to lose contracts in some cities. Tesla\\'s designs were never put into production, possibly because of technical improvements in incandescent street lighting or because of an installation deal that Edison made with an arc lighting company.Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when Tesla quit. What event precipitated Tesla leaving is unclear. What event may have been over a bonus Tesla did not receive, either for redesigning generators or for the arc lighting system that was shelved. Tesla had previous run-ins with the Edison company over unpaid bonuses Tesla believed Tesla had earned. In Tesla autobiography, Tesla stated the manager of the Edison Machine Works offered a $50,000 bonus to design \"twenty-four different types of standard machines\" \"but Tesla turned out to be a practical joke\". Later versions of this story have Thomas Edison himself offering and then reneging on the deal, quipping \"Tesla, you don\\'t understand our American humor\". The size of the bonus in either story has been noted as odd since Machine Works manager Batchelor was stingy with pay and Tesla did not have that amount of cash equivalent to $1.4 million in 2021 on hand. Tesla\\'s diary contains just one comment on what happened at the end of his employment, a note his scrawled across the two pages covering 7 December 1884, to 4 January 1885, saying \"Good by to the Edison Machine Works\".',\n",
              " ' Tesla Electric Light  Manufacturing Soon after leaving the Edison company, Tesla was working on patenting an arc lighting system, possibly the same one he had developed at Edison. In March 1885, he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell, the same attorney used by Edison, to obtain help with submitting the patents. Serrell introduced Tesla to two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla\\'s name, the Tesla Electric Light  Manufacturing. Tesla worked for the rest of the year obtaining the patents that included an improved DC generator, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US, and building and installing the system in Rahway, New Jersey. Tesla\\'s new system gained notice in the technical press, which commented on Tesla\\'s new system advanced features.The investors showed little interest in Tesla\\'s ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, The investors decided that the manufacturing side of the business was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. The investors formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents Tesla had generated, since Tesla had assigned The investors to Tesla in exchange for stock. Tesla had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla recounted that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing \"My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed to Tesla like a mockery\".',\n",
              " \"In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck. Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck were experienced in setting up companies and promoting inventions and patents for financial gain. Based on Tesla's new ideas for electrical equipment, including a thermo-magnetic motor idea, Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck agreed to back the inventor financially and handle the inventor patents. Together Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck formed the Tesla Electric Company in April 1887, with an agreement that profits from generated patents would go ⅓ to Tesla, ⅓ to Peck and Brown, and ⅓ to fund development. Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles Fletcher Peck set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices.In 1887, Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current AC, a power system format that was rapidly expanding in Europe and the United States because of Tesla advantages in long-distance, high-voltage transmission. The motor used polyphase current, which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor a principle that Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882. This innovative electric motor, patented in May 1888, was a simple self-starting design that did not need a commutator, thus avoiding sparking and the high maintenance of constantly servicing and replacing mechanical brushes.Along with getting the motor patented, Peck and Brown arranged to get the motor publicized, starting with independent testing to verify The motor was a functional improvement, followed by press releases sent to technical publications for articles to run concurrently with the issue of the patent. Physicist William Arnold Anthony who tested the motor and Electrical World magazine editor Thomas Commerford Martin arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his AC motor on 16 May 1888 at the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric  Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power system—something Westinghouse needed for the alternating current system his was already marketing. Westinghouse looked into getting a patent on a similar commutator-less, rotating magnetic field-based induction motor developed in 1885 and presented in a paper in March 1888 by Italian physicist Galileo Ferraris, but decided that Tesla's patent would probably control the market.\",\n",
              " \"In July 1888, Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 $57,600 in today's dollars per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric  Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs.During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. Tesla found Tesla a frustrating period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between the other Westinghouse engineers, the other Westinghouse engineers settled on a 60-cycle AC system that Tesla proposed to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor, but the other Westinghouse engineers soon found that it would not work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. the other Westinghouse engineers ended up using a DC traction motor instead.\",\n",
              " ' Market turmoil Tesla\\'s demonstration of Tesla induction motor and Westinghouse\\'s subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, came at the time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three big firms, Westinghouse, Edison, and Thomson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital-intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a \"war of currents\" propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim Edison Electric direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla\\'s motor and the related polyphase system right away.Two years after signing the Tesla contract, Westinghouse Electric was in trouble. The near collapse of Barings Bank in London triggered the financial panic of 1890, causing investors to call in investors loans to Westinghouse Electric. The sudden cash shortage forced Edison Electric to refinance Edison Electric debts. The new lenders demanded that Westinghouse cut back on what looked like excessive spending on acquisition of other companies, research, and patents, including the per motor royalty in the Tesla contract. At that point, the Tesla induction motor had been unsuccessful and was stuck in development. Westinghouse was paying a $15,000-a-year guaranteed royalty even though operating examples of the motor were rare and polyphase power systems needed to run it was even rarer. In early 1891, George Westinghouse explained the Westinghouse financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that, if the Westinghouse did not meet the demands of the Westinghouse lenders, the Westinghouse would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to \"deal with the bankers\" to try to collect future royalties. The advantages of having Westinghouse continue to champion the motor probably seemed obvious to Tesla and the Westinghouse agreed to release Tesla from the royalty payment clause in the contract. Six years later Westinghouse purchased Tesla\\'s patent for a lump sum payment of $216,000 as part of a patent-sharing agreement signed with General Electric a company created from the 1892 merger of Edison and Thomson-Houston.',\n",
              " 'The money Tesla made from licensing Tesla AC patents made Tesla independently wealthy and gave Tesla the time and funds to pursue Tesla own interests. In 1889, Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop Peck and Brown had rented and for the next dozen years working out of a series of workshoplaboratory spaces in Manhattan. These included a lab at 175 Grand Street 1889–1892, the fourth floor of 33–35 South Fifth Avenue 1892–1895, and sixth and seventh floors of 46  48 East Houston Street 1895–1902. Tesla and Tesla hired staff conducted some of Tesla most significant work in these workshops.',\n",

Tesla found this new discovery \"refreshing\" and decided to explore this new discovery more fully. In repeating, and then expanding on, these experiments, Tesla tried powering a Ruhmkorff coil with a high speed alternator Tesla had been developing as part of an improved arc lighting system but found that the high-frequency current overheated the iron core and melted the insulation between the primary and secondary windings in the coil. To fix this problem Tesla came up with Tesla \"oscillating transformer\", with an air gap instead of insulating material between the primary and secondary windings and an iron core that could be moved to different positions in or out of the coil. Later called the Tesla coil, a Ruhmkorff coil would be used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla would use this resonant transformer circuit in Tesla later wireless power work.',\n",

              " 'After 1890, Tesla experimented with transmitting power by inductive and capacitive coupling using high AC voltages generated with Tesla Tesla coil. Tesla attempted to develop a wireless lighting system based on near-field inductive and capacitive coupling and conducted a series of public demonstrations where Tesla lit Geissler tubes and even incandescent light bulbs from across a stage. Tesla spent most of the decade working on variations of this new form of lighting with the help of various investors but none of the ventures succeeded in making a commercial product out of Tesla findings.In 1893 at St. Louis, Missouri, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the National Electric Light Association, Tesla told onlookers that Tesla was sure a system like Tesla could eventually conduct \"intelligible signals or perhaps even power to any distance without the use of wires\" by conducting a system like his through the Earth.Tesla served as a vice-president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers from 1892 to 1894, the forerunner of the modern-day IEEE along with the Institute of Radio Engineers.',\n",

              " 'By the beginning of 1893, Westinghouse engineer Charles F. Scott and then Benjamin G. Lamme had made progress on an efficient version of Tesla\\'s induction motor. Lamme found a way to make the polyphase system Benjamin G. Lamme would need compatible with older single-phase AC and DC systems by developing a rotary converter. Westinghouse Electric now had a way to provide electricity to all potential customers and started branding all potential customers polyphase AC system as the \"Tesla Polyphase System\". all potential customers believed that Tesla\\'s patents gave all potential customers patent priority over other polyphase AC systems.Westinghouse Electric asked Tesla to participate in the 1893 World\\'s Columbian Exposition in Chicago where Westinghouse Electric had a large space in the \"Electricity Building\" devoted to electrical exhibits. Westinghouse Electric won the bid to light the Exposition with alternating current and Westinghouse Electric was a key event in the history of AC power, as Westinghouse Electric demonstrated to the American public the safety, reliability, and efficiency of an alternating current system that was polyphase and could also supply the other AC and DC exhibits at the fair.A special exhibit space was set up to display various forms and models of Tesla\\'s induction motor. The rotating magnetic field that drove them was explained through a series of demonstrations including an Egg of Columbus that used the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg making the two-phase coil found in an induction motor to spin a copper egg stand on end.Tesla visited the fair for a week during Tesla six-month run to attend the International Electrical Congress and put on a series of demonstrations at the Westinghouse exhibit. A specially darkened room had been set up where Tesla showed his wireless lighting system, using a demonstration his had previously performed throughout America and Europe these included using high-voltage, high-frequency alternating current to light wireless gas-discharge lamps.An observer noted:',\n",
              " 'Within the room were suspended two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil. two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil were about fifteen feet apart and served as terminals of the wires leading from the transformers. When the current was turned on, the lamps or tubes, which had no wires connected to two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil, but lay on a table between the suspended plates, or which might be held in the hand in almost any part of the room, were made luminous. two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil were the same experiments and the same apparatus shown by Tesla in London about two years previous, \"where two hard-rubber plates covered with tin foil produced so much wonder and astonishment\".',\n",
              " 'During his presentation at the International Electrical Congress in the Columbian Exposition Agriculture Hall, Tesla introduced his Steam powered reciprocating electricity generator that his patented that year, something his thought was a better way to generate alternating current. Steam was forced into the oscillator and rushed out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. This did away with the complicated parts of a steam enginegenerator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.',\n",
              " \" Consulting on Niagara In 1893, Adams, sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. Tesla awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that Tesla could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.\",\n",

Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. The board found few investors the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents the mid-1890s was set up to market never panned out.

Tesla\\'s lab started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla\\'s 4th-floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla\\'s ongoing projects, but fire also destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told The New York Times \"I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?\" After the fire Tesla moved to 46  48 East Houston Street and rebuilt Tesla lab on the 6th and 7th floors.',\n",
              " 'Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of \"invisible\" kinds after he had noticed damaged film in he laboratory in previous experiments later identified as \"Roentgen rays\" or \"X-Rays\". he early experiments were with Crookes tubes, a cold cathode electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have inadvertently captured an X-ray image—predating, by a few weeks, Wilhelm Röntgen\\'s December 1895 announcement of the discovery of X-rays—when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by a Geissler tube, an earlier type of gas discharge tube. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens.',\n",
              " 'In March 1896, after hearing of Röntgen\\'s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging radiography, Tesla proceeded to do Tesla own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal vacuum tube of Tesla own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is bremsstrahlung or braking radiation. In Tesla research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with Tesla circuits, the \"instrument will ... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".Tesla noted the hazards of working with Tesla circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In Tesla many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, Tesla attributed the skin damage to various causes. Tesla believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the ozone generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by nitrous acid. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in waves in plasmas. These plasma waves can occur in force-free magnetic fields.On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that occasionally took place while experimenting with he single-electrode vacuum tubes.  A minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike he:',\n",
              " 'Tesla said Tesla could feel a sharp stinging pain where Tesla entered Tesla body, and again at the place where Tesla passed out. In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by Tesla \"electric gun,\" Tesla said, \"The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and such particles will travel in concentrations\".',\n",
              " ' Radio remote control In 1898, Tesla demonstrated a boat that used a coherer-based radio control—which he dubbed \"telautomaton\"—to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden. Tesla tried to sell he idea to the US military as a type of radio-controlled torpedo, but the US military showed little interest. Remote radio control remained a novelty until World War I and afterward, when a number of countries used a number of countries in military programs. Tesla took the opportunity to further demonstrate \"Teleautomatics\" in an address to a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, while Tesla was travelling to Colorado Springs, on 13 May 1899.',\n",
              " 'From the 1890s through 1906, Tesla spent a great deal of Tesla time and fortune on a series of projects trying to develop the transmission of electrical power without wires. It was an expansion of Tesla idea of using coils to transmit power that Tesla had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. Tesla saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as Tesla had pointed out in Tesla earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.At the time Tesla was formulating Tesla ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power. Tesla had studied radio waves early on, and came to the conclusion that part of the existing study on them, by Hertz, was incorrect. Also, this new form of radiation was widely considered at the time to be a short-distance phenomenon that seemed to die out in less than a mile. Tesla noted that, even if theories on radio waves were true, they were totally worthless for Tesla intended purposes since this form of \"invisible light\" would diminish over a distance just like any other radiation and would travel in straight lines right out into space, becoming \"hopelessly lost\".By the mid-1890s, Tesla was working on the idea that Tesla might be able to conduct electricity long distance through the Earth or the atmosphere, and began working on experiments to test this idea including setting up a large resonance transformer magnifying transmitter in Tesla East Houston Street lab. Seeming to borrow from a common idea at the time that the Earth\\'s atmosphere was conductive, Tesla proposed a system composed of balloons suspending, transmitting, and receiving, electrodes in the air above 30,000 feet 9,100 m in altitude, where Tesla thought the lower pressure would allow Tesla to send high voltages millions of volts long distances.',\n",
              " \"To further study the conductive nature of low-pressure air, Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899.  There Tesla could safely operate much larger coils than in the cramped confines of Tesla New York lab, and an associate had made an arrangement for the El Paso Power Company to supply alternating current free of charge. To fund Tesla experiments, Tesla convinced John Jacob Astor IV to invest $100,000 $3,110,800 in today's dollars to become a majority shareholder in the Nikola Tesla Company. Astor thought Astor was primarily investing in the new wireless lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund Astor Colorado Springs experiments. Upon Astor arrival, Astor told reporters that Astor planned to conduct wireless telegraphy experiments, transmitting signals from Pikes Peak to Paris.\",\n",
              " 'There, he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning and thunder consisting of millions of volts and discharges of up to 135 feet 41 m in length, and, at one point, inadvertently burned out the generator in El Paso, causing a power outage. The observations he made of the electronic noise of lightning strikes led he to incorrectly conclude that he could use the entire globe of the Earth to conduct electrical energy.During he time at he laboratory, Tesla observed unusual signals from he receiver which he speculated to be communications from another planet. he mentioned them in a letter to a reporter in December 1899 and to the Red Cross Society in December 1900. Reporters treated Tesla as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion Tesla was hearing signals from Mars. he expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 February 1901 Collier\\'s Weekly article entitled \"Talking With Planets\", where he said Tesla had not been immediately apparent to he that he was hearing \"intelligently controlled signals\" and that the signals could have come from Mars, Venus, or other planets. It has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted Guglielmo Marconi\\'s European experiments in July 1899—Marconi may have transmitted the letter S dotdotdot in a naval demonstration, the same three impulses that Tesla hinted at hearing in Colorado—or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission.Tesla had an agreement with the editor of The Century Magazine to produce an article on he findings. The magazine sent a photographer to Colorado to photograph the work being done there. The article, titled \"The Problem of Increasing Human Energy\", appeared in the June 1900 edition of The Century Magazine. he explained the superiority of the wireless system he envisioned but the article was more of a lengthy philosophical treatise than an understandable scientific description of he work, illustrated with what were to become iconic images of Tesla and he Colorado Springs experiments.',\n",
              " 'Tesla made the rounds in New York trying to find investors for what Tesla thought would be a viable system of wireless transmission, wining and dining them at the Waldorf-Astoria\\'s Palm Garden the hotel where Tesla was living at the time, The Players Club, and Delmonico\\'s. In March 1901, Tesla obtained $150,000 $4,666,200 in today\\'s dollars from J. P. Morgan in return for a 51% share of any generated wireless patents, and began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York, 100 miles 161 km east of the city on the North Shore of Long Island.By July 1901, Tesla had expanded Tesla plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi\\'s radio-based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of Tesla own. Tesla approached Morgan to ask for more money to build the larger system, but Morgan refused to supply any further funds. In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission. A month after Marconi\\'s success, Tesla tried to get Morgan to back an even larger plan to transmit messages and power by controlling \"vibrations throughout the globe\". Over the next five years, Tesla wrote more than 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued the project for another nine months into 1902. the Tower was erected to the Tower full height of 187 feet 57 m. In June 1902, Tesla moved Tesla lab operations from Houston Street to Wardenclyffe.Investors on Wall Street were putting Investors on Wall Street money into Marconi\\'s system, and some in the press began turning against Tesla\\'s project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905, and in 1906, the financial problems and other events may have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla\\'s part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover Tesla debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually amounted to $20,000 $516,700 in today\\'s dollars. Tesla lost the property in foreclosure in 1915, and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.',\n",
              " ' Later years After Wardenclyffe closed, Tesla continued to write to Morgan after \"the great man\" died, Tesla wrote to Morgan son Jack, trying to get further funding for the project. In 1906, Tesla opened offices at 165 Broadway in Manhattan, trying to raise further funds by developing and marketing Morgan\\'s son Jack patents. Morgan\\'s son Jack went on to have offices at the Metropolitan Life Tower from 1910 to 1914 rented for a few months at the Woolworth Building, moving out because Morgan\\'s son Jack could not afford the rent and then to office space at 8 West 40th Street from 1915 to 1925. After moving to 8 West 40th Street, Morgan\\'s son Jack was effectively bankrupt. Most of Morgan\\'s son Jack patents had run out and Morgan\\'s son Jack was having trouble with the new inventions Morgan\\'s son Jack was trying to develop.',\n",

During 1910–1911, at the Waterside Power Station in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000 hp. Tesla worked with several companies including from 1919 to 1922 in Milwaukee, for Allis-Chalmers. his spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at Tesla, but engineering difficulties meant the Tesla turbine was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and Tesla found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.',\n",

Telefunken brought in the physicists Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for the two countries defense, and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.In 1915, Tesla attempted to sue the Marconi Company for infringement of Tesla wireless tuning patents. Marconi's initial radio patent had been awarded in the US in 1897, but Tesla 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission had been rejected several times, before his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission was finally approved in 1904, on the grounds that his 1900 patent submission covering improvements to radio transmission infringed on other existing patents including two 1897 Tesla wireless power tuning patents. Tesla's 1915 case went nowhere, but in a related case, where the Marconi Company tried to sue the US government over WWI patent infringements, a Supreme Court of the United States 1943 decision restored the prior patents of Oliver Lodge, John Stone, and Tesla. The court declared that The court decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patented improvements were questionable, the company could not claim infringement on those same patents.\",\n",

There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that either Tesla or Edison had refused the prize. The Nobel Foundation said, \"Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because a person has made known a person intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous\" a recipient could decline a Nobel Prize only after a person is announced a winner.There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither was given the award because of Edison and Tesla animosity toward each other that each sought to minimize the other\\'s achievements and right to win the award that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received the award first that both rejected any possibility of sharing the award and even that a wealthy Edison refused the award to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won a Nobel Prize although Edison received one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla received one of 38 possible bids in 1937.',\n",

Tesla also tried to develop a variation of this a few years later as a room sanitizer for hospitals.Tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence. In 1912, Tesla crafted \"a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity,\" wiring the walls of a schoolroom and, \"saturating the schoolroom with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency. The whole room will thus, Mr. Tesla claims, be converted into a health-giving and stimulating electromagnetic field or \\'bath.\\'\" The plan was, at least provisionally, approved by then superintendent of New York City schools, William H. Maxwell.Before World War I, Tesla sought overseas investors. After the war started, Tesla lost the funding Tesla was receiving from Tesla patents in European countries.In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter, Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an \"electric ray\" of \"tremendous frequency,\" with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar. Tesla was incorrect in Tesla assumption that high-frequency radio waves would penetrate water. Émile Girardeau, who helped develop France\\'s first radar system in the 1930s, noted in 1953 that Tesla\\'s general speculation that a very strong high-frequency signal would be needed was correct. Girardeau said, \"Tesla was prophesying or dreaming, since he had at he disposal no means of carrying them out, but one must add that if he was dreaming, at least he was dreaming correctly\".In 1928, Tesla received he last patent, U.S. Patent 1,655,114, for a biplane design capable of vertical take-off and landing VTOL, which \"gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices\" in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane. Tesla thought the plane would sell for less than $1,000. Although the aircraft has been described as impractical, the aircraft has early resemblances to the V-22 Osprey used by the US military. At this point Tesla closed he remaining office located at 350 Madison Ave, having moved there two years earlier.',\n",

Tesla moved to the St. Regis Hotel in 1922 and followed a pattern from then on of moving to a different hotel every few years and leaving unpaid bills behind.Tesla walked to the park every day to feed the pigeons. Tesla began feeding the pigeons at the window of Tesla hotel room and nursed injured birds back to health. Tesla said that Tesla had been visited by a certain injured white pigeon daily. Tesla spent over $2,000 to care for the bird, including a device Tesla built to support her comfortably while her broken wing and leg healed. Tesla stated:',\n",

It was a female. I had only to wish and call a female and a female would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and a woman loved me. As long as I had a woman, there was a purpose to my life.Tesla\\'s unpaid bills, as well as complaints about the mess made by pigeons, led to his eviction from St. Regis in 1923. his was also forced to leave the Hotel Pennsylvania in 1930 and the Hotel Governor Clinton in 1934. At one point his also took rooms at the Hotel Marguery.Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker in 1934. At this time Westinghouse Electric  Manufacturing Company began paying his $125 per month in addition to paying his rent. Accounts of how this came about vary. Several sources claim that Westinghouse was concerned, or possibly warned, about potential bad publicity arising from the impoverished conditions in which their former star inventor was living. The payment has been described as being couched as a \"consulting fee\" to get around Tesla\\'s aversion to accepting charity. Tesla biographer Marc Seifer described the Westinghouse payments as a type of \"unspecified settlement\".

Tesla claimed it was a theory of energy that was \"violently opposed\" to Einsteinian physics and could be tapped with an apparatus that would be cheap to run and last 500 years. Tesla also told reporters Tesla was working on a way to transmit individualized private radio wavelengths, working on breakthroughs in metallurgy, and developing a way to photograph the retina to record thought.At the 1934 occasion, Tesla told reporters Tesla had designed a superweapon Tesla claimed would end all war. Tesla called it \"teleforce\", but was usually referred to as Tesla death ray. Tesla described Tesla as a defensive weapon that would be put up along the border of a country and be used against attacking ground-based infantry or aircraft. Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during Tesla lifetime but, in 1984, Tesla surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing millions of volts in streams through electrostatic repulsion. Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.In 1935 at his 79th birthday party, Tesla covered many topics. his claimed to have discovered the cosmic ray in 1896 and invented a way to produce direct current by induction, and made many claims about his mechanical oscillator. Describing the device which his expected would earn his $100 million within two years his told reporters that a version of his oscillator had caused an earthquake in his 46 East Houston Street lab and neighboring streets in Lower Manhattan in 1898. his went on to tell reporters his oscillator could destroy the Empire State Building with 5 lbs of air pressure. his also explained a new technique his developed using his oscillators his called \"Telegeodynamics\", using his oscillator to transmit vibrations into the ground that his claimed would work over any distance to be used for communication or locating underground mineral deposits.In his 1937 Grand Ballroom of Hotel New Yorker event, Tesla received the Order of the White Lion from the Czechoslovak ambassador and a medal from the Yugoslav ambassador.

Tesla was a polyglot, speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin. Tesla related in Tesla autobiography that Tesla experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During Tesla early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. Tesla suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light appeared before Tesla eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea Tesla might have come across at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem Tesla had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, Tesla could envision Just by hearing the name of an item in realistic detail. Tesla visualized an invention in Tesla mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as picture thinking. Tesla typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in Tesla childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in Tesla life.',\n",
              " ' Relationships Tesla was a lifelong bachelor, who had once explained that Tesla chastity was very helpful to Tesla scientific abilities. Tesla once said in earlier years that Tesla felt Tesla could never be worthy enough for a woman, considering women superior in every way. Tesla opinion had started to sway in later years when Tesla felt that women were trying to outdo men and make women more dominant. This \"new woman\" was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing women femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the Galveston Daily News on 10 August 1924 Tesla stated, \"In place of the soft-voiced, a gentlewoman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that This \"new woman chief success in life lies in making This \"new woman as much as possible like man—in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind ... The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with Tesla in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.\" Although Tesla told a reporter in later years that Tesla sometimes felt that by not marrying, Tesla had made too great a sacrifice to Tesla work, Tesla chose to never pursue or engage in any known relationships, instead finding all the stimulation Tesla needed in Tesla work.Tesla was asocial and prone to seclude Tesla with Tesla work. However, when Tesla did engage in social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described Tesla as attaining a \"distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force\". Robert Underwood Johnson secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: \"Robert Underwood Johnson genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in Robert Underwood Johnson soul\". Tesla\\'s friend, Julian Hawthorne, wrote, \"seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink\".Tesla was a good friend of Francis Marion Crawford, Robert Underwood Johnson, Stanford White, Fritz Lowenstein, George Scherff, and Kenneth Swezey. In middle age, Tesla became a close friend of Mark Twain they spent a lot of time together in his lab and elsewhere. Twain notably described Tesla\\'s induction motor invention as \"the most valuable patent since the telephone\". At a party thrown by actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1896, Tesla met Indian Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda. Vivekananda later wrote that Tesla said Tesla could demonstrate mathematically the relationship between matter and energy, something Vivekananda hoped would give a scientific foundation to Vedantic cosmology. In the late 1920s, Tesla befriended George Sylvester Viereck, a poet, writer, mystic, and later, a Nazi propagandist. Tesla occasionally attended dinner parties held by Viereck and Viereck wife.Tesla could be harsh at times and openly expressed disgust for overweight people, such as when Tesla fired a secretary because of a secretary weight. Tesla was quick to criticize clothing on several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change a secretary dress.

During Tesla second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passionate proficiency for billiards, chess, and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table. On one occasion at Tesla laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called Swezey at 3 a.m.: \"I was sleeping in my room like one dead ... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me ... Tesla spoke animatedly, with pauses, as Swezey ... worked out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting and when Swezey felt Swezey had arrived at the solution, Swezey suddenly closed the telephone.\"',\n",

Tesla then telephoned his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve his. \"The meal was required to be ready at eight o\\'clock ... his dined alone, except on the rare occasions when his would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla then resumed his work, often until 3:00 a.m.\"For exercise, Tesla walked between 8 and 10 miles 13 and 16 km per day. his curled his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, saying that it stimulated his brain cells.In an interview with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla said that Tesla did not believe in telepathy, stating, \"Suppose I made up my mind to murder you,\" Tesla said, \"In a second you would know it. Now, isn\\'t that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?\" In the same interview, Tesla said that Tesla believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.Tesla became a vegetarian in Tesla later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.',\n",

Tesla believed that atoms are immutable—electrons existed at all could not change state or be split in any way. no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge was a believer in the 19th-century concept of an all-pervasive ether that transmitted electrical energy.Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy. no such thing as an electron creating an electric charge was also critical of Einstein\\'s theory of relativity, saying:',\n",

God has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties our can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.Tesla claimed to have developed Tesla own physical principle regarding matter and energy that Tesla started working on in 1892, and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a \"dynamic theory of gravity\" that \"would put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space\". Tesla stated that the theory was \"worked out in all details\" and that Tesla hoped to soon give the theory to the world. Further elucidation of Tesla theory was never found in Tesla writings.',\n",

This did not preclude Tesla, like many of his era, from becoming a proponent of an imposed selective breeding version of eugenics.Tesla expressed the belief that human \"pity\" had come to interfere with the natural \"ruthless workings of nature\". Though his argumentation did not depend on a concept of a \"master race\" or the inherent superiority of one person over another, his advocated for eugenics. In a 1937 interview his stated:',\n",
              " '... man\\'s new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct ... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now A century from now will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward gender equality, and indicated that humanity\\'s future would be run by \"Queen Bees\". \"Queen Bees\" believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, \"Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War\" 20 December 1914.

At the age of 16, He obtained He Baccalaureate in 1914 to become the youngest student at that time to be awarded such a certificate, also ranking second. He preferred to enroll in the Teachers' College rather than the faculties of Medicine or Engineering due to He deep interest in mathematics.He graduated in 1917. Due to He excellence in mathematics, the Egyptian Ministry of Education sent He to England where He obtained BSc Honors from the University of Nottingham, 1920. The Egyptian University consented to grant Mosharafa another scholarship to complete He doctoral thesis. During He stay in London, many of He scientific researches were published in prominent science magazines. He obtained a PhD in 1923 from King's College London in the shortest possible time permissible according to the regulations there.

              " 'Sir Isaac Newton  25 December 1642 – 20 March 172627 was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian, and author described in his time as a \"natural philosopher\" widely recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all time and among the most influential scientists. his was a key figure in the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. his book Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, first published in 1687, established classical mechanics. his also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing infinitesimal calculus.In the Principia, his formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. his used his mathematical description of gravity to derive Kepler\\'s laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the Solar System\\'s heliocentricity. his demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. his\\'s inference that the Earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of Maupertuis, La Condamine, and others, convincing most European scientists of the superiority of Newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.his built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. his work on light was collected in his highly influential book Opticks, published in 1704. his also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a Newtonian fluid. In addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician his contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.his was a fellow of Trinity College and the second Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. his was a devout but unorthodox Christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity. Unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day, his refused to take holy orders in the Church of England. Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, his dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. Politically and personally tied to the Whig party, his served two brief terms as Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, in 1689–1690 and 1701–1702. his was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in London, serving as Warden 1696–1699 and Master 1699–1727 of the Royal Mint, as well as president of the Royal Society 1703–1727.',\n",
              " 'Isaac Newton was born according to the Julian calendar in use in England at the time on Christmas Day, 25 December 1642 NS 4 January 1643, \"an hour or two after midnight\", at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire. His father, also named Isaac Newton, had died three months before. Born prematurely, Newton was a small child Isaac Newton mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that Isaac Newton could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, Isaac Newton mother remarried and went to live with Isaac Newton new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving Isaac Newton son in the care of her son maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough née Blythe. Newton disliked Isaac Newton stepfather and maintained some enmity towards Isaac Newton mother for marrying Isaac Newton, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: \"Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn my father and mother Smith and the house over my father and mother Smith.\" Newton\\'s mother had three children Mary, Benjamin and Hannah from Newton\\'s mother second marriage.From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King\\'s School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Ancient Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. he was removed from school and returned to Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth by October 1659. he mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make he a farmer, an occupation he hated. Henry Stokes, master at The King\\'s School, persuaded he mother to send he back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing he mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of he uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. he started as a subsizar—paying he way by performing valet\\'s duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing he four more years until he could get he MA. At that time Trinity College, Cambridge\\'s teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street, through whom he learned of Kepler\\'s work. he set down in he notebook a series of \"Quaestiones\" about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained he BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton\\'s private studies at he home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of he theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.In April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity. Fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient. However, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then he unconventional views stood in the way. Nevertheless, Newton managed to avoid it by means of special permission from Charles II.Newton studies had impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was more anxious to develop Newton own religious and administrative potential Newton became master of Trinity two years later in 1669 Newton succeeded Newton, only one year after receiving Newton MA. Newton was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society FRS in 1672.',\n",
              " 'Newton\\'s work has been said \"to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied\". Newton work on the subject, usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton\\'s mathematical papers. Newton work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas, sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669, was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins that August as the work \"of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things\".Newton later became involved in a dispute with Leibniz over priority in the development of calculus the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy. Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. Occasionally it has been suggested that Newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while Leibniz began publishing a full account of Leibniz methods in 1684. Leibniz\\'s notation and \"differential Method\", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental European mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by British mathematicians.Leibniz work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the Principia itself, Newton gave demonstration of this under the name of \"the method of first and last ratios\" and explained why Leibniz put Leibniz expositions in this form, remarking also that \"hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.\"Because of this, the Principia has been called \"a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus\" in modern times and in Newton\\'s time \"nearly all of the Principia itself is of this calculus.\" Leibniz use of methods involving \"one or more orders of the infinitesimally small\" is present in Leibniz De motu corporum in gyrum of 1684 and in Leibniz papers on motion \"during the two decades preceding 1684\".',\n",
              " 'Newton had been reluctant to publish Newton calculus because Newton feared controversy and criticism. Newton was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton\\'s Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society accused Leibniz of plagiarism. The dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labelled Leibniz a fraud it was later found that Newton wrote the study\\'s concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter\\'s death in 1716.Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. Newton discovered Newton\\'s identities, Newton\\'s method, classified cubic plane curves polynomials of degree three in two variables, made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. Newton approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms a precursor to Euler\\'s summation formula and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton\\'s work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin\\'s decimals.When Newton received Newton MA and became a Fellow of the \"College of the Holy and Undivided Trinity\" in 1667, Newton made the commitment that \"I will either set Theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes 7 years arrives, or I will resign from the college.\" Up until this point Newton had not thought much about religion and had twice signed Newton agreement to the thirty-nine articles, the basis of Church of England doctrine.Newton was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669, on Barrow\\'s recommendation. During that time, any Fellow of a college at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church – presumably, so as to have more time for science. Newton argued that this should exempt Newton from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton\\'s religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.',\n",
              " \"In 1666, Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led Newton to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light – a point which had, until then, been a matter of debate.From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period Newton investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured image produced by a prism, which Newton named a spectrum, could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.Newton showed that coloured light does not change coloured light properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining coloured light on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, Newton observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.\",\n",
              " \"From this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours chromatic aberration. As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground Newton own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for Newton telescopes. In late 1668, Newton was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight inches long and It gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of Newton reflecting telescope. the Royal Society interest encouraged Newton to publish Newton notes, Of Colours, which Newton later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that Robert Hooke withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.\",\n",
              " 'Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. Newton verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12, but still retained Newton theory of \\'fits\\' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted Props.13. However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today\\'s quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton\\'s understanding of light.In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More revived the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More interest in alchemy. the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton\\'s writings on alchemy, stated that \"Newton was not the first of the age of reason: the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More was the last of the magicians.\" Newton\\'s interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from Newton contributions to science. This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. Had Newton not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, Newton might not have developed Newton theory of gravity.In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which Newton expounded Newton corpuscular theory of light. Newton considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation \"Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ... and may not Bodies receive much of gross Bodies and Light Activity from the Particles of Light which enter gross Bodies and Light Composition?\" Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.In Newton book Opticks, Newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. Some 278 years after Newton\\'s discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. Also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Young and Fresnel combined Newton\\'s particle theory with Huygens\\' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light\\'s wavelength. Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet and scientist, Goethe, could not shake the Newtonian foundation but \"one hole Goethe did find in Newton\\'s armour, ... Newton had committed \" Newton to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. \" Newton, therefore, thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must forever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.\"',\n",
              " 'In 1679, Newton returned to Newton work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and Newton effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler\\'s laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society\\'s correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton\\'s reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. Newton communicated Newton results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society\\'s Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.The Principia was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. the three universal laws of motion contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advances continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. Newton used the Latin word gravitas weight for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.In the same work, Newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using \\'first and last ratios\\', gave the first analytical determination based on Boyle\\'s law of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth\\'s spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the Moon\\'s gravitational attraction on the Earth\\'s oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the Moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.Newton made clear Newton heliocentric view of the Solar System—developed in a somewhat modern way because already in the mid-1680s Newton recognised the \"deviation of the Sun\" from the centre of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton, it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather \"the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem\\'d the Centre of the World\", and this centre of gravity \"either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line\" Newton adopted the \"at rest\" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest.Newton\\'s postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to Newton being criticised for introducing \"occult agencies\" into science. Later, in the second edition of the Principia 1713, Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did but they did not so far indicate its cause, and its was they unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. Here Newton used what became his famous expression \"hypotheses non-fingo\".With the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised. Newton acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier.In 1710, Newton found 72 of the 78 \"species\" of cubic curves and categorised a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier into four types.  In 1717, and probably with Newton\\'s help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of the four types, and this was proved in 1731, four years after Newton death.',\n",
              " \"In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which John Locke disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5:7—the Johannine Comma—and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament, remained unpublished until 1785.Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts John Locke only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed. John Locke was, however, noted by Cambridge diarist Abraham de la Pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that Newton had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Newton took charge of England's great recoining, trod on the toes of Lord Lucas, Governor of the Tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley. Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of Newton life. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took These appointments seriously. Newton retired from Newton Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised Newton authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.As Warden, and afterwards as Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, however, Newton proved equal to the task.Disguised as a habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence he. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton had Newton made a justice of the peace in all the home counties. A draft letter regarding the matter is included in Newton's personal first edition of Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, which Newton must have been amending at the time. Then Newton conducted more than 100 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between June 1698 and Christmas 1699. Newton successfully prosecuted 28 coiners.\",\n",

In Newton position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed\\'s Historia Coelestis Britannica, which Newton had used in Newton studies.In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge. The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in May 1705, rather than any recognition of Newton\\'s scientific work or services as Master of the Mint. Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Francis Bacon.As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of Francis Bacon Majesty\\'s Treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not. this has been argued that Newton conceived of Newton work at the Mint as a continuation of Newton alchemical work.Newton was invested in the South Sea Company and lost some £20,000 £4.4 million in 2020 when the South Sea Company collapsed in around 1720.Toward the end of Newton life, Newton took up residence at Cranbury Park, near Winchester, with Newton niece and her husband, until Newton death. his niece and her husband, served as Newton hostess in social affairs at Newton house on Jermyn Street in London Newton was her \"very loving Uncle\", according to Newton letter to her when her was recovering from smallpox.',\n",

Newton was given a ceremonial funeral, attended by nobles, scientists, and philosophers, and was buried in Westminster Abbey among kings and queens. Newton is also the first scientist to be buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at Voltaire . A bachelor, Voltaire had divested much of Voltaire estate to relatives during Voltaire last years, and died intestate. Voltaire papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton.After Voltaire , Newton's hair was examined and found to contain Mercury, probably resulting from Voltaire alchemical pursuits.

The French writer and philosopher Voltaire, who was in London at the time of Newton\\'s funeral, said that he \"was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with women—a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended he in he last moments\". This now-widespread belief that he died a virgin has been commented on by writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan.Newton had a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom Newton met in London around 1689—some of writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan correspondence has survived. writers as diverse as mathematician Charles Hutton, economist John Maynard Keynes, and physicist Carl Sagan relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown, which included sending wild accusatory letters to Newton friends Samuel Pepys and John Locke. Newton note to the latter included the charge that Locke \"endeavoured to embroil me with woemen\".Newton was relatively modest about Newton achievements, writing in a letter to Robert Hooke in February 1676, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Two writers think that the sentence, written at a time when Newton and Hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on Hooke said to have been short and hunchbacked, rather than—or in addition to—a statement of modesty. On the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet George Herbert a former orator of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College in his Jacula Prudentum 1651, had as its main point that \"a dwarf on a giant\\'s shoulders sees farther of the two\", and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than Hooke as the \\'dwarf\\'.In a later memoir, Newton wrote, \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.\"In 2015, Steven Weinberg, a Nobel laureate in physics, called Newton \"a nasty antagonist\" and \"a bad man to have as an enemy\". Newton particularly noted Newton\\'s attitude towards Robert Hooke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.It has been suggested from these and other traits, and Newton profound power of concentration, that Newton may have had a form of high-functioning autism, known as Asperger\\'s syndrome.',\n",

              " 'Newton himself often told the story that Newton himself was inspired to formulate Newton himself theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree. The story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by Catherine Barton, Newton\\'s niece, to Voltaire. Voltaire then wrote in Voltaire Essay on Epic Poetry 1727, \"Sir Isaac Newton walking in Voltaire gardens, had the first thought of Voltaire system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.\"Although an apple has been said that the apple story is a myth and that Voltaire did not arrive at Voltaire theory of gravity at any single moment, acquaintances of Newton such as William Stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton\\'s head. Stukeley recorded in Stukeley Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton\\'s Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726:we went into the garden,  drank thea under the shade of some appletrees, only he,  Stukeley. amidst other discourse, Stukeley told me, Stukeley was just in the same situation, as when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into Stukeley mind. \"why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground,\" thought Stukeley to Stukeley self: occasion\\'d by the fall of an apple, as Stukeley sat in a comtemplative mood: \"why should it not go sideways, or upwards? but constantly to the earths centre? assuredly, the reason is, that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter.  the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center, not in any side of the earth. therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly, or toward the center. if matter thus draws matter this apple must be in proportion of this apple quantity. therefore the apple draws the earth, as well as the earth draws the apple.\"John Conduitt, Newton\\'s assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton\\'s niece, also described the event when he wrote about Newton\\'s life:In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to he mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into he thought that the power of gravity which brought an apple from a tree to the ground was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to he  if so, that must influence her motion  perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.',\n",
              " 'It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the Moon however, it took Newton two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether The question extended so far from Earth that The question could also be the force holding the Moon to the Moon orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon\\'s orbital period, and get good agreement. Newton guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named the force holding the Moon to its orbit \"universal gravitation\".Various trees are claimed to be \"the\" apple tree which Newton describes. The King\\'s School, Grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster\\'s garden some years later. The staff of the now National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton.

              " 'Although born into an Anglican family, by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity, with one historian labelling his a heretic.By 1672, his had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which his showed to no one and which have only recently been examined. his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early Church writings and show that in the conflict between Athanasius and Arius which defined the Creed, his took the side of Arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity. Newton \"recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man, who was subordinate to the Father who created Christ.\" Christ was especially interested in prophecy, but for Christ, \"the great apostasy was trinitarianism.\"Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. At the last moment in 1675 Christ received a dispensation from the government that excused Christ and all future holders of the Lucasian chair.In Newton\\'s eyes, worshipping Christ as God was idolatry, to Christ the fundamental sin. In 1999, historian Stephen D. Snobelen wrote, \"Isaac Newton was a heretic. But ... Newton never made a public declaration of Newton private faith—which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. Newton hid Newton faith so well that scholars are still unraveling Newton personal beliefs.\" Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser Newton owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books, possibly an Arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.The view that Newton was Semi-Arian has lost support now that scholars have investigated Newton\\'s theological papers, and now most scholars identify Newton as an Antitrinitarian monotheist.',\n",
              " 'Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries, he warned against using the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton\\'s best-known discoveries to view the Universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. he said, \"So then gravity may put the planets into motion, but without the Divine Power the Divine Power could never put the planets into such a circulating motion, as the planets have about the sun\".Along with he scientific fame, Newton\\'s studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. Newton placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.Newton believed in a rationally immanent world, but Newton rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. In his correspondence, Newton claimed that in writing the Principia \"I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity\". Newton saw evidence of design in the system of the world: \"Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice\". But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities. For this, Leibniz lampooned Newton: \"God Almighty wants to wind up Newton watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. Newton had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.\"Newton\\'s position was vigorously defended by Newton follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence. A century later, Pierre-Simon Laplace\\'s work Celestial Mechanics had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention. The contrast between Laplace\\'s mechanistic worldview and Newton\\'s one is the most strident considering the famous answer which the French scientist gave Napoleon, who had criticised Pierre-Simon Laplace\\'s for the absence of the Creator in the Mécanique céleste: \"Sire, j\\'ai pu me passer de cette hypothèse\" \"Sir, I didn\\'t need this hypothesis\".Scholars long debated whether Newton disputed the doctrine of the Trinity. Newton first biographer, David Brewster, who compiled Newton manuscripts, interpreted Newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the Trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the Trinity as such. In the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes among others were deciphered and encrypted manuscripts written by Newton and bought by John Maynard Keynes among others became known that Newton did indeed reject Trinitarianism.',\n",

Few remember that Newton spent half Newton life muddling with alchemy, looking for the philosopher\\'s stone. That was the pebble by the seashore Newton really wanted to find.\"Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton\\'s papers, about one million deal with alchemy. Many of Newton\\'s writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with Newton own annotations. Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets. Some of the content contained in Newton\\'s papers could have been considered heretical by the church.In 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloguing Newton\\'s papers, Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby\\'s. The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton\\'s collection of papers on alchemy before donating John Maynard Keynes collection to Cambridge University in 1946.All of Newton\\'s known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University: \"The Chymistry of Isaac Newton\" and summarised in a book.Newton\\'s fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction, the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors, and the formulation of the calculus. Yet there is another, more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known, a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of Newton life, although Newton kept it largely hidden from Newton contemporaries and colleagues. We refer to Newton\\'s involvement in the discipline of alchemy, or as it was often called in seventeenth-century England, \"chymistry.\"Charles Coulston Gillispie disputes that Newton ever practised alchemy, saying that \"Charles Coulston Gillispie chemistry was in the spirit of Boyle\\'s corpuscular philosophy.\"In June 2020, two unpublished pages of Newton\\'s notes on Jan Baptist van Helmont\\'s book on plague, De Peste, were being auctioned online by Bonhams. Newton\\'s analysis of this book, which Charles Coulston Gillispie made in Cambridge while protecting Charles Coulston Gillispie from London\\'s 1665–1666 infection, is the most substantial written statement Charles Coulston Gillispie is known to have made about the plague, according to Bonhams. As far as the therapy is concerned, Newton writes that \"the best is a toad suspended by the legs in a chimney for three days, which at last vomited up earth with various insects in it, on to a dish of yellow wax, and shortly after died. Combining powdered toad with the excretions and serum made into lozenges and worn about the affected area drove away the contagion and drew out the poison\".',\n",
              " \" The Enlightenment Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of Boyle, and Newton applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.it is held by European philosophers of the Enlightenment and by historians of the Enlightenment that Newton's publication of the Principia was a turning point in the Scientific Revolution and started the Enlightenment. It was Newton's conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress.

Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn to develop Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn special theory of relativity. Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn then extended the theory to gravitational fields Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn theory of gravitation. In 1917, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe. Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.However, for much of the later part of Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn career, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn great contributions to quantum mechanics, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn opposed what it evolved into, objecting that nature \"does not play dice\". Second, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.Einstein was born in the German Empire, but moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn German citizenship as a subject of the Kingdom of Württemberg the following year. In 1897, at the age of 17, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich, graduating in 1900. In 1901, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn acquired Swiss citizenship, which Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn kept for the rest of Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn life, and in 1903 Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn secured a permanent position at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. In 1914, Einstein moved to Berlin in order to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the Humboldt University of Berlin. In 1917, Einstein became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics Albert Einstein  EYEN-styne German: ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn also became a German citizen again, this time Prussian.In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Einstein, of Jewish origin, objected to the policies of the newly elected Nazi government Adolf Hitler settled in the United States and became an American citizen in 1940. On the eve of World War II, Adolf Hitler endorsed a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting Adolf Hitler to the potential German nuclear weapons program and recommending that the US begin similar research. Einstein supported the Allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons.',\n",
              " 'Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879 into a family of secular Ashkenazi Jews. Albert Einstein parents were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein\\'s father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein  Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich, from the age of five, for three years. At the age of eight, Albert was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium, where Albert received advanced primary and secondary school education until Albert left the German Empire seven years later.In 1894, Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because Hermann and Jakob\\'s company lacked the capital to convert Hermann and Jakob\\'s company equipment from the direct current DC standard to the more efficient alternating current AC standard. The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein, then 15, stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. his father intended for his to pursue electrical engineering, but Einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the school\\'s regimen and teaching method. his later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. At the end of December 1894, his traveled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let his go by using a doctor\\'s note. During his time in Italy his wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic Field\".Einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The 12-year-old Einstein taught his algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single summer. Einstein also independently discovered Einstein own original proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. A family tutor Max Talmud says that after A family tutor Max Talmud had given the 12-year-old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time \"Einstein had worked through the whole book. A family tutor Max Talmud thereupon devoted A family tutor Max Talmud to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of A family tutor Max Talmud mathematical genius was so high I could not follow.\" A family tutor Max Talmud passion for geometry and algebra led the 12-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a \"mathematical structure\". Einstein started teaching A family tutor Max Talmud calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old A family tutor Max Talmud says A family tutor Max Talmud had \"mastered integral and differential calculus\".At age 13, when A family tutor Max Talmud had become more seriously interested in philosophy and music, Einstein was introduced to Kant\\'s Critique of Pure Reason. Kant became his favorite philosopher, Kant tutor stating: \"At the time A family tutor Max Talmud was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant\\'s works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to A family tutor Max Talmud.\"',\n",
              " \"In 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the Swiss Federal polytechnic school in Zürich later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH. Einstein failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. On the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school, Einstein attended the Argovian cantonal school gymnasium in Aarau, Switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete Einstein secondary schooling. While lodging with the family of Professor Jost Winteler, Einstein fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie. Albert's sister Maja later married Winteler's son Paul. In January 1896, with Winteler's son Paul father's approval, Einstein renounced Winteler's son Paul citizenship in the German Kingdom of Württemberg to avoid military service. In September 1896 Winteler's son Paul passed the Swiss Matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1–6. At 17, Winteler's son Paul enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Federal polytechnic school. Marie Winteler, who was a year older, moved to Olsberg, Switzerland, for a teaching post.Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić, also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year. Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into a romance, and Einstein's and Marić's friendship spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein's and Marić's friendship were both interested. Einstein wrote in Einstein letters to Marić that Einstein preferred studying alongside Einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old Serbian named Mileva Marić. In 1900, Einstein passed the exams in Maths and Physics and was awarded a Federal teaching diploma. There is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate Marić might have collaborated with Einstein prior to Einstein landmark 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, and that his landmark 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers developed some of the concepts together during his landmark 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers studies, although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions.\",\n",
              " 'Early correspondence between Einstein and Marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named \"Lieserl\", born in early 1902 in Novi Sad where Marić was staying with Marić parents. Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. The contents of Einstein\\'s letter in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.Einstein and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904, Einstein and Marić son Hans Albert Einstein was born in Bern, Switzerland. Einstein and Marić son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. The couple moved to Berlin in April 1914, but Marić returned to Zürich with the couple sons after learning that, despite the couple close relationship before, Einstein\\'s chief romantic attraction was now Marić cousin Elsa Löwenthal his cousin Elsa Löwenthal was Marić first cousin maternally and second cousin paternally. Einstein and Marić divorced on 14 February 1919, having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce settlement, Einstein agreed to give Marić Marić future in the event, 1921 Nobel Prize money.In letters revealed in 2015, Einstein wrote to Einstein early love Marie Winteler about Einstein marriage and Einstein strong feelings for Marie Winteler. Einstein wrote in 1910, while Einstein wife was pregnant with their second child: \"I think of his wife was pregnant with their second child in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be.\" Einstein spoke about a \"misguided love\" and a \"missed life\" regarding Einstein love for Marie.Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919, after having had a relationship with his wife since 1912. They emigrated to the United States in 1933. his wife was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in December 1936.In 1923, Einstein fell in love with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of a close friend, Hans Mühsam. In a volume of letters released by Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2006, Einstein described about six women, including Margarete Lebach a blonde Austrian, Estella Katzenellenbogen the rich owner of a florist business, Toni Mendel a wealthy Jewish widow and Ethel Michanowski a Berlin socialite, with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to his wife. Later, after the death of he second wife Elsa, Einstein was briefly in a relationship with Margarita Konenkova. Konenkova was a Russian spy who was married to the noted Russian sculptor Sergei Konenkov who created the bronze bust of Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.Einstein\\'s son Eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Princeton.Einstein\\'s son Eduard mother cared for Princeton.Einstein\\'s son Eduard and Princeton.Einstein\\'s son Eduard was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after His mother death.',\n",
              " 'After graduating in 1900, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann\\'s father, Marcel Grossmann\\'s secured a job in Bern at the Swiss Patent Office, as an assistant examiner – level III.Einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, Marcel Grossmann\\'s position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although Marcel Grossmann\\'s was passed over for promotion until Marcel Grossmann\\'s \"fully mastered machine technology\".Much of Marcel Grossmann\\'s work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to Marcel Grossmann\\'s radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.',\n",
              " 'With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Sometimes a small discussion group were joined by Mileva who attentively listened but did not participate. a small discussion group readings included the works of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.',\n",

On 30 April 1905, Einstein completed Einstein dissertation, A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions with Alfred Kleiner, Professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Zürich, serving as pro-forma advisor. Einstein work was accepted in July, and Einstein was awarded a Ph.D.Also in 1905, which has been called Einstein\\'s annus mirabilis amazing year, Einstein published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring Einstein to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.',\n",

The following year, after By 1908 gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended By 1908 to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.Einstein became a full professor at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During By 1908 Prague stay, By 1908 wrote 11 scientific works, five of Austrian citizenship on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids.In July 1912, By 1908 returned to By 1908 alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, By 1908 was a professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where By 1908 taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. By 1908 also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which By 1908 worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.When the \"Manifesto of the Ninety-Three\" was published in October 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent German intellectuals that justified Germany\\'s militarism and position during the First World War—Einstein was one of the few German intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic \"Manifesto to the Europeans\".',\n",
              " 'In the spring of 1913, Einstein was enticed to move to Berlin with an offer that included membership in the Prussian Academy of Sciences, and a linked University of Berlin professorship, enabling Einstein to concentrate exclusively on research. On 3 July 1913, Einstein became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Max Planck and Walther Nernst visited Einstein the next week in Zurich to persuade Einstein to join the academy, additionally offering Einstein the post of director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, which was soon to be established. Membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at Humboldt University of Berlin. Einstein was officially elected to the academy on 24 July, and Einstein moved to Berlin the following year. Einstein decision to move to Berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near Einstein cousin Elsa, with whom Einstein had started a romantic affair. Einstein assumed Einstein position with the academy, and Berlin University, after moving into Einstein Dahlem apartment on 1 April 1914. As World War I broke out that year, the plan for Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was aborted. Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics was established on 1 October 1917, with Einstein as Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics director. In 1916, Einstein was elected president of the German Physical Society 1916–1918.In 1911, Einstein used his 1907 Equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the Sun\\'s gravity. In 1913, Einstein improved upon those calculations by using Riemannian space-time to represent the gravity field. By the fall of 1915, Einstein had successfully completed Einstein general theory of relativity, which Einstein used to calculate that deflection, and the perihelion precession of Mercury. In 1919, that deflection prediction was confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. Those observations were published in the international media, making Einstein world-famous. On 7 November 1919, the leading British newspaper The Times printed a banner headline that read: \"Revolution in Science – New Theory of the Universe – Newtonian Ideas Overthrown\".In 1920, Sir Arthur Eddington became a Foreign Member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1922, Sir Arthur Eddington was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for Sir Arthur Eddington services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for Sir Arthur Eddington discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\". While the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law, as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the Planck spectrum by S. N. Bose. Einstein was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society ForMemRS in 1921. Einstein also received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1925.Einstein resigned from the Prussian Academy in March 1933. Einstein\\'s scientific accomplishments while in Berlin, included finishing the general theory of relativity, proving the gyromagnetic effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and Bose–Einstein statistics.',\n",

Einstein went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington, Einstein accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Sciences on a visit to the White House. On Einstein return to Europe Einstein was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where Einstein met several renowned scientific, intellectual, and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King\\'s College London.Einstein also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.\", in July 1921, in which Einstein tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as had Alexis de Tocqueville, who published Einstein own impressions in Democracy in America 1835. For some of Einstein observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\"In 1922, Einstein travels took Einstein to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as Einstein visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where Einstein gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After Einstein first public lecture, Einstein met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to Einstein sons, Einstein described Einstein impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. In Einstein own travel diaries from Einstein 1922–23 visit to Asia, Einstein expresses some views on the Chinese, Japanese and Indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when xenophobic and racist judgments were rediscovered in 2018.Because of Einstein\\'s travels to the Far East, Einstein was unable to personally accept the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922. In Einstein place, the banquet speech was made by a German diplomat, who praised Einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.On Einstein return voyage, Einstein visited Palestine for 12 days, Einstein only visit to that region. Einstein was greeted as if Einstein were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear Einstein. In Einstein\\'s talk to the audience, Einstein expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.Einstein visited Spain for two weeks in 1923, where Einstein briefly met Santiago Ramón y Cajal and also received a diploma from King Alfonso XIII naming Einstein a member of the Spanish Academy of Sciences.',\n",

Originally slated to serve as the Swiss delegate, Secretary-General Eric Drummond was persuaded by Catholic activists Oskar Halecki and Giuseppe Motta to instead have Oskar Halecki become the German delegate, thus allowing Gonzague de Reynold to take the Swiss spot, from which Gonzague de Reynold promoted traditionalist Catholic values.

After the national attention, he received during he first trip to the US, he and he arrangers aimed to protect he privacy. Although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.After arriving in New York City, Einstein was taken to various places and events, including Chinatown, a lunch with the editors of The New York Times, and a performance of Carmen at the Metropolitan Opera, where he was cheered by the audience on he arrival. During the days following, he was given the keys to New York City by Mayor Jimmy Walker and met the president of Columbia University, who described Einstein as \"the ruling monarch of the mind\". Harry Emerson Fosdick, pastor at New York\\'s Riverside Church, gave Einstein a tour of New York\\'s Riverside Church and showed Einstein a full-size statue that the church made of Einstein, standing at the entrance. Also during he stay in New York, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at Madison Square Garden during a Hanukkah celebration.',\n",
              " 'Einstein next traveled to California, where Einstein met Caltech president and Nobel laureate Robert A. Millikan. Einstein friendship with Millikan was \"awkward\", as Millikan \"had a penchant for patriotic militarism\", where Einstein was a pronounced pacifist. During an address to Caltech\\'s students, Einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.This aversion to war also led Einstein to befriend author Upton Sinclair and film star Charlie Chaplin, both noted for both pacifism. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios, gave Einstein a tour of Einstein studio and introduced Einstein to Chaplin. Carl Laemmle, head of Universal Studios had an instant rapport, with Chaplin inviting Einstein and Einstein wife, Elsa, to Einstein home for dinner. Chaplin said Einstein\\'s outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a \"highly emotional temperament\", from which came Chaplin \"extraordinary intellectual energy\".Chaplin\\'s film, City Lights, was to premiere a few days later in Hollywood, and Chaplin invited Einstein and Elsa to join Chaplin as Chaplin special guests. Walter Isaacson, Einstein\\'s biographer, described this as \"one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity\". Chaplin visited Einstein at Chaplin home on a later trip to Berlin and recalled Chaplin \"modest little flat\" and the piano at which Chaplin had begun writing Chaplin theory.

In February and March 1933, the Gestapo repeatedly raided Einstein family's apartment in Berlin. Einstein and Einstein wife Elsa returned to Europe in March, and during the trip, He and his wife Elsa learned that the German Reichstag had passed the Enabling Act on 23 March, transforming Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship, and that He and his wife Elsa would not be able to proceed to Berlin. Later on, He and his wife Elsa heard that He and his wife Elsa cottage had been raided by the Nazis and Einstein's personal sailboat confiscated. Upon landing in Antwerp, Belgium on 28 March, Einstein immediately went to the German consulate and surrendered Einstein passport, formally renouncing Einstein German citizenship.

Historian Gerald Holton describes how, with \"virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues\", thousands of Jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up thousands of Jewish scientists university positions and thousands of Jewish scientists names were removed from the rolls of institutions where thousands of Jewish scientists were employed.A month later, Einstein\\'s works were among those targeted by the German Student Union in the Nazi book burnings, with Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels proclaiming, \"Jewish intellectualism is dead.\" One German magazine included him in a list of enemies of the German regime with the phrase, \"not yet hanged\", offering a $5,000 bounty on him head. In a subsequent letter to physicist and friend Max Born, who had already emigrated from Germany to England, Einstein wrote, \"... I must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise.\" After moving to the US, him described the book burnings as a \"spontaneous emotional outburst\" by those who \"shun popular enlightenment\", and \"more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence\".Einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where him would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in Germany. him rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where him lived for a few months. In late July 1933, him went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. Locker-Lampson invited him to stay near him Cromer home in a wooden cabin on Roughton Heath in the Parish of Roughton, Norfolk. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at him secluded cabin a photo of two bodyguards carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein was published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.Locker-Lampson took Einstein to meet Winston Churchill at him home, and later, Austen Chamberlain and former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Einstein asked two bodyguards to help bring Jewish scientists out of Germany. British historian Martin Gilbert notes that Churchill responded immediately, and sent British historian Martin Gilbert friend, physicist Frederick Lindemann, to Germany to seek out Jewish scientists and place Jewish scientists in British universities. Churchill later observed that as a result of Germany having driven the Jews out, the Jews had lowered the Jews \"technical standards\" and put the Allies\\' technology ahead of the Jews.Einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including Turkey\\'s Prime Minister, İsmet İnönü, to whom Einstein wrote in September 1933 requesting placement of unemployed German-Jewish scientists. As a result of Einstein\\'s letter, Jewish invitees to Turkey eventually totaled over \"1,000 saved individuals\".Locker-Lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend British citizenship to Einstein, during which period Einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in Europe. In one of his speeches his denounced Germany\\'s treatment of Jews, while at the same time his introduced a bill promoting Jewish citizenship in Palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. In his speech his described Einstein as a \"citizen of the world\" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the UK.

Einstein had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford, where Einstein stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a five-year studentship, but in 1935, Einstein arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.Einstein's affiliation with the Institute for Advanced Study would last until Einstein death in 1955. Einstein was one of the four first selected along with John von Neumann and Kurt Gödel at the new Institute, where Einstein soon developed a close friendship with Gödel.

Einstein and Szilárd, along with other refugees such as Edward Teller and Eugene Wigner, \"regarded it as their responsibility to alert Americans to the possibility that German scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that Hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon.\" To make certain the US was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilárd and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. he was asked to lend he support by writing a letter, with Szilárd, to President Roosevelt, recommending the US pay attention and engage in the US own nuclear weapons research.The letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\". In addition to the letter, Einstein used Einstein connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House\\'s Oval Office. Some say that as a result of Einstein\\'s letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the US entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.For Einstein, \"war was a disease ... and he called for resistance to war.\" By signing the letter to Roosevelt, some argue President Roosevelt went against President Roosevelt pacifist principles. In 1954, a year before President Roosevelt death, Einstein said to President Roosevelt old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life—when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made but there was some justification—the danger that the Germans would make the Germans ...\" In 1955, Einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists, including British philosopher Bertrand Russell, signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons.',\n",

Not long after settling into Einstein career at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, Einstein expressed Einstein appreciation of the meritocracy in American culture when compared to Europe. Einstein recognized the \"right of individuals to say and think what individuals pleased\", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, Einstein said, to be more creative, a trait Einstein valued from Einstein own early education.Einstein joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People NAACP in Princeton, where Einstein campaigned for the civil rights of African Americans. Einstein considered racism America\\'s \"worst disease\", seeing America\\'s \"worst disease\" as \"handed down from one generation to the next\". As part of Einstein involvement, Einstein corresponded with civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois and was prepared to testify on Einstein behalf during Einstein trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case.In 1946, Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where Einstein was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\".',\n",

Earlier, in 1921, Einstein was asked by the biochemist and president of the World Zionist Organization, Chaim Weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. Einstein also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.Among those, Einstein advised first creating an Institute of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed, Einstein suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which Einstein called an \"evil\" that was undermining a third of the country\\'s development. Establishing an Oriental Studies Institute, to include language courses given in both Hebrew and Arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and the country historical monuments, was also important.Einstein was not a nationalist Einstein was against the creation of an independent Jewish state, which would be established without Einstein help as Israel in 1948. Einstein felt that the waves of arriving Jews of the Aliyah could live alongside existing Arabs in Palestine. Einstein views were not shared by the majority of Jews seeking to form a new country as a result, Einstein was limited to a marginal role in the Zionist movement.Chaim Weizmann later became Israel\\'s first president. Upon Chaim Weizmann death while in office in November 1952 and at the urging of Ezriel Carlebach, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion offered Einstein the position of President of Israel, a mostly ceremonial post. The offer was presented by Israel\\'s ambassador in Washington, Abba Eban, who explained that the offer \"embodies the deepest respect which the Jewish people can repose in any of the Jewish people sons\".

However, Einstein did not enjoy it at that age.When Einstein turned 13, Einstein discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon Einstein became enamored of Mozart\\'s compositions and studied music more willingly. Einstein taught Einstein to play without \"ever practicing systematically\". Einstein said that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\" At age 17, Einstein was heard by a school examiner in Aarau while playing Beethoven\\'s violin sonatas. The examiner stated afterward that Einstein playing was \"remarkable and revealing of \\'great insight\\'\". What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\"Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein\\'s life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on a professional musician himself mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and a professional musician himself performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of a professional musician himself social life while living in Bern, Zürich, and Berlin, where a professional musician himself played with Max Planck and a professional musician himself son, among others. a professional musician himself is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Köchel catalog of Mozart\\'s work that edition was prepared by Alfred Einstein, who may have been a distant relation.In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, a professional musician himself visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where a professional musician himself played some of Beethoven and Mozart\\'s works with members of the Zoellner Quartet.

In 1925, Einstein criticized His opinions on the Bolsheviks for not having a \\'well-regulated system of government\\' and called His opinions on the Bolsheviks rule a \\'regime of terror and a tragedy in human history\\'. Einstein later adopted a more moderated view, criticizing His opinions on the Bolsheviks methods but praising His opinions on the Bolsheviks, which is shown by Einstein 1929 remark on Vladimir Lenin: \"In Lenin I honor a man, who in total sacrifice of \"In Lenin own person has committed \"In Lenin entire energy to realizing social justice.

Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.',\n",

Einstein\\'s \"Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter Körper\" \"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\" reconciled conflicts between Maxwell\\'s equations the laws of electricity and magnetism and the laws of Newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. Observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light.

There is evidence from Einstein\\'s writings that he collaborated with he first wife, Mileva Marić, on this work. The decision to publish only under he name seems to have been mutual, but the exact reason is unknown.This paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in the body itself direction of motion. This paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.In his paper on mass–energy equivalence, Einstein produced E  mc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations. Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck.Einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics the study of moving bodies.

              " 'General relativity GR is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. special relativity provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion even accelerated ones should appear more satisfactory. Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.In 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.',\n",
              " \" Gravitational waves In 1916, Einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.The first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, PSR B1913+16. The explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that their were emitting gravitational waves. Einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 February 2016, when researchers at LIGO published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on Earth on 14 September 2015, nearly one hundred years after the prediction.\",\n",
              " \" Hole argument and Entwurf theory While developing general relativity, Einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. Einstein formulated an argument that led Einstein to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. Einstein gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.In June 1913, the Entwurf 'draft' theory was the result of these investigations. As the Entwurf 'draft' theory name suggests, the Entwurf 'draft' theory was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\",\n",
              " 'In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. Einstein discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein\\'s understanding of Mach\\'s principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein\\'s static universe.Following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by Edwin Hubble in 1929, Einstein abandoned Einstein static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, The Friedmann-Einstein universe of 1931 and the Einstein–de Sitter universe of 1932. In each of these models, Einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was \"in any case theoretically unsatisfactory\".In many Einstein biographies, it is claimed that Einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his \"biggest blunder\". The astrophysicist Mario Livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that this claim may be exaggerated.In late 2013, a team led by the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of Hubble\\'s observations of the recession of the nebulae, Einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh associated with the cosmological constant. As the Irish physicist Cormac O\\'Raifeartaigh stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention to a solution to equation 1 that can account for Hubbel\\'s sic facts, and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving one considers a physically bounded volume. For the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.\"It thus appears that Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, Einstein\\'s steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and Einstein quickly abandoned the idea.',\n",
              " \"General relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.Einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. Einstein maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was, in fact, the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by Lev Landau and Evgeny Lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.The use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by Erwin Schrödinger and others.\",\n",

So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.This was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by Roy Kerr for spinning objects.',\n",

After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.Einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments Wilhelm Wien had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. Arnold Sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.',\n",

Einstein also published Einstein own articles describing the model and its implications, among Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik the Bose–Einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.

In a thought experiment, Einstein considered two particles, which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. No matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle likewise, a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.Given Einstein\\'s concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: 1 either the other particle had these properties already determined, or 2 the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. Einstein rejected this second possibility popularly called \"spooky action at a distance\".Einstein\\'s belief in local realism led Einstein to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. But as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the Aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed Bell\\'s theorem, which J. S. Bell had delineated in 1964. The results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which \"particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after the other have separated.\"Although Einstein was wrong about local realism, Einstein clear prediction of the unusual properties of Einstein opposite, entangled quantum states, has resulted in the EPR paper becoming among the top ten papers published in Physical Review. Einstein is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.',\n",

In 1950, his described his \"unified field theory\" in a Scientific American article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\". Although his was lauded for this work, his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.Notably, Einstein\\'s unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces, neither of which were well understood until many years after his death.

In order to show this, Einstein and De Haas reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. Einstein and De Haas confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but This experiment definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\",\n",

Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.This formulation is a form of second quantization, but This formulation predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas.

Edison developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. Edison was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. Edison established the first industrial research laboratory.Edison was raised in the American Midwest early in Edison career, Edison worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of Edison earliest inventions. In 1876, Edison established Edison first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of Edison early inventions were developed. Edison later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. Edison was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in Edison name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children.

              " 'Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. Thomas Edison was the seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. 1804–1896, born in Marshalltown, Nova Scotia and Nancy Matthews Elliott 1810–1871, born in Chenango County, New York. Thomas Edison patrilineal family line was Dutch by way of New Jersey the surname had originally been \"Edeson\". the surname grandfather John Edeson fled New Jersey for Nova Scotia in 1784, His grandfather John Edeson father moved to Vienna, Ontario and fled after His grandfather John Edeson involvement in the Rebellion of 1837.Edison was taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by His grandfather John Edeson mother, who used to be a school teacher. His grandfather John Edeson attended school for only a few months. However, one biographer described His grandfather John Edeson as a very curious child who learned most things by reading on His grandfather John Edeson own. As a child, His grandfather John Edeson became fascinated with technology and spent hours working on experiments at home.Edison developed hearing problems at the age of 12. The cause of His grandfather John Edeson deafness has been attributed to a bout of scarlet fever during childhood and recurring untreated middle-ear infections. His grandfather John Edeson subsequently concocted elaborate fictitious stories about the cause of His grandfather John Edeson deafness. As His grandfather John Edeson was completely deaf in one ear and barely hearing in the other, it is alleged that Edison would listen to a music player or piano by clamping His grandfather John Edeson teeth into the wood to absorb the sound waves into His grandfather John Edeson skull. As His grandfather John Edeson got older, Edison believed His grandfather John Edeson hearing loss allowed His grandfather John Edeson to avoid distraction and concentrate more easily on His grandfather John Edeson work. Modern-day historians and medical professionals have suggested His grandfather John Edeson may have had ADHD.It is known that early in His grandfather John Edeson career His grandfather John Edeson enrolled in a chemistry course at The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, to support His grandfather John Edeson work on a new telegraphy system with Charles Batchelor. This appears to have been His grandfather John Edeson only enrollment in courses at an institution of higher learning.',\n",
              " \" Early career Thomas Edison began Thomas Edison career selling candy, newspapers and vegetables on the trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. Thomas Edison turned a $50-a-week profit by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and chemical experiments. Thomas Edison became a telegraph operator after Thomas Edison saved 3-year-old Jimmie MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that Thomas Edison trained Edison as a telegraph operator. Edison's first telegraphy job away from Port Huron was at Stratford Junction, Ontario, on the Grand Trunk Railway. Thomas Edison was held responsible for a near collision. Thomas Edison also studied qualitative analysis and conducted chemical experiments on the train until Thomas Edison left the job.Edison obtained the exclusive right to sell newspapers on the road, and, with the aid of four assistants, Thomas Edison set in type and printed the Grand Trunk Herald, which Thomas Edison sold with Thomas Edison other papers. This began Edison's long streak of entrepreneurial ventures, as Thomas Edison discovered Thomas Edison talents as a businessman. Ultimately, Thomas Edison entrepreneurship was central to the formation of some 14 companies, including General Electric, still one of the largest publicly traded companies in the world.In 1866, at the age of 19, Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western Union, Thomas Edison worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested the night shift, which allowed Thomas Edison plenty of time to spend at Thomas Edison two favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter pre-occupation cost Thomas Edison Thomas Edison job. One night in 1867, Thomas Edison was working with a lead–acid battery when Thomas Edison spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor. acid ran between the floorboards and onto Thomas Edison boss's desk below. The next morning Edison was fired.Thomas Edison first patent was for the electric vote recorder, U.S. Patent 90,646, which was granted on June 1, 1869. Finding little demand for the machine, Edison moved to New York City shortly thereafter. One of Thomas Edison mentors during those early years was a fellow telegrapher and inventor named Franklin Leonard Pope, who allowed the impoverished youth to live and work in the basement of Thomas Edison Elizabeth, New Jersey, home, while Edison worked for Samuel Laws at the Gold Indicator Company. Pope and Edison founded Pope and Edison own company in October 1869, working as electrical engineers and inventors. Edison began developing a multiplex telegraphic system, which could send two messages simultaneously, in 1874.\",\n",
              " 'Edison\\'s major innovation was the establishment of an industrial research lab in 1876. Edison was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township now named Edison Township in his honor in Middlesex County, New Jersey, with the funds from the sale of Edison\\'s quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell Edison for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so his asked Western Union to make a bid. his was surprised to hear Western Union offer $10,000 $228,700 in today\\'s dollars, which his gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison\\'s first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally credited with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. his staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and his drove His staff hard to produce results.William Joseph Hammer, a consulting electrical engineer, started working for Edison and began his duties as a laboratory assistant in December 1879. his assisted in experiments on the telephone, phonograph, electric railway, iron ore separator, electric lighting, and other developing inventions. However, Hammer worked primarily on the incandescent electric lamp and was put in charge of tests and records on that device see Hammer Historical Collection of Incandescent Electric Lamps. In 1880, his was appointed chief engineer of the Edison Lamp Works. In his first year, the plant under general manager Francis Robbins Upton turned out 50,000 lamps. According to Edison, Hammer was \"a pioneer of incandescent electric lighting\". Frank J. Sprague, a competent mathematician and former naval officer, was recruited by Edward H. Johnson and joined the Edison organization in 1883. One of Sprague\\'s contributions to the Edison Laboratory at Menlo Park was to expand Edison\\'s mathematical methods. Despite the common belief that Edison did not use mathematics, analysis of his notebooks reveal that his was an astute user of mathematical analysis conducted by his assistants such as Francis Robbins Upton, for example, determining the critical parameters of his electric lighting system including lamp resistance by an analysis of Ohm\\'s Law, Joule\\'s Law and economics.Nearly all of Edison\\'s patents were utility patents, which were protected for 17 years and included inventions or processes that are electrical, mechanical, or chemical in nature. About a dozen were design patents, which protect an ornamental design for up to 14 years. As in most patents, the inventions his described were improvements over prior art. The phonograph patent, in contrast, was unprecedented in describing the first device to record and reproduce sounds.In just over a decade, Edison\\'s Menlo Park laboratory had expanded to occupy two city blocks. Edison said Edison wanted Edison\\'s Menlo Park laboratory to have \"a stock of almost every conceivable material\". A newspaper article printed in 1887 reveals the seriousness of Edison claim, stating the lab contained \"eight thousand kinds of chemicals, every kind of screw made, every size of needle, every kind of cord or wire, hair of humans, horses, hogs, cows, rabbits, goats, minx, camels ... silk in every texture, cocoons, various kinds of hoofs, shark\\'s teeth, deer horns, tortoise shell ... cork, resin, varnish and oil, ostrich feathers, a peacock\\'s tail, jet, amber, rubber, all ores ...\" and the list goes on.Over his desk Edison displayed a placard with Sir Joshua Reynolds\\' famous quotation: \"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\" This slogan was reputedly posted at several other locations throughout the facility.In Menlo Park, Edison had created the first industrial laboratory concerned with creating knowledge and then controlling Edison application. Edison\\'s name is registered on 1,093 patents.',\n",
              " 'Edison began Edison career as an inventor in Newark, New Jersey, with the automatic repeater and Edison other improved telegraphic devices, but the invention that first gained Edison wider notice was the phonograph in 1877. This accomplishment was so unexpected by the public at large as to appear almost magical. Edison became known as \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\".His first phonograph recorded on tinfoil around a grooved cylinder. Despite Edison limited sound quality and that the recordings could be played only a few times, the phonograph made Edison a celebrity. Joseph Henry, president of the National Academy of Sciences and one of the most renowned electrical scientists in the US, described Edison as \"the most ingenious inventor in the US... or in any other\". In April 1878, Edison traveled to Washington to demonstrate the phonograph before the National Academy of Sciences, Congressmen, Senators and US President Hayes. The Washington Post described Edison as a \"genius\" and his presentation as \"a scene... that will live in history\". Although Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878, his did little to develop Edison obtained a patent for the phonograph in 1878 until Alexander Graham Bell, Chichester Bell, and Charles Tainter produced a phonograph-like device in the 1880s that used wax-coated cardboard cylinders.',\n",
              " ' Carbon telephone transmitter In 1876, Edison began work to improve the microphone for telephones at that time called a \"transmitter\" by developing a carbon microphone, which consists of two metal plates separated by granules of carbon that would change resistance with the pressure of sound waves. A steady direct current is passed between the plates through the granules and the varying resistance results in a modulation of the current, creating a varying electric current that reproduces the varying pressure of the sound wave.Up to that point, microphones, such as the ones developed by Johann Philipp Reis and Alexander Graham Bell, worked by generating a weak current. The carbon microphone works by modulating a direct current and, subsequently, using a transformer to transfer the signal so generated to the telephone line. Edison was one of many inventors working on the problem of creating a usable microphone for telephony by having it modulate an electrical current passed through it. His work was concurrent with Emile Berliner\\'s loose-contact carbon transmitter who lost a later patent case against Edison over the carbon transmitter\\'s invention and David Edward Hughes study and published paper on the physics of loose-contact carbon transmitters work that Hughes did not bother to patent.Edison used the carbon microphone concept in 1877 to create an improved telephone for Western Union. In 1886, Edison found a way to improve a Bell Telephone microphone, one that used loose-contact ground carbon, with His discovery that Edison worked far better if the carbon was roasted. This type was put in use in 1890 and was used in all telephones along with the Bell receiver until the 1980s.',\n",
              " 'In 1878, Edison began working on a system of electrical illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil-based lighting. he began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, something that would be needed for indoor use. However, Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb. In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue developed an efficient light bulb using a coiled platinum filament but the high cost of platinum kept the bulb from becoming a commercial success. Many other inventors had also devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta\\'s demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel.These early bulbs all had flaws such as an extremely short life and requiring a high electric current to operate which made These early bulbs all difficult to apply on a large scale commercially.:\\u200a217–218\\u200a In his first attempts to solve these problems, Edison tried using a filament made of cardboard, carbonized with compressed lampblack. This burnt out too quickly to provide lasting light. his then experimented with different grasses and canes such as hemp, and palmetto, before settling on bamboo as the best filament. Edison continued trying to improve this design and on November 4, 1879, filed for U.S. patent 223,898 granted on January 27, 1880 for an electric lamp using \"a carbon filament or strip coiled and connected to platina contact wires\".The patent described several ways of creating the carbon filament including \"cotton and linen thread, wood splints, papers coiled in various ways\". It was not until several months after the patent was granted that Edison and his team discovered that a carbonized bamboo filament could last over 1,200 hours.',\n",
              " 'In 1878, Edison formed the Edison Electric Light Company in New York City with several financiers, including J. P. Morgan, Spencer Trask, and the members of the Vanderbilt family. Edison made the first public demonstration of Edison incandescent light bulb on December 31, 1879, in Menlo Park. It was during this time that Edison said: \"Edison will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.\"',\n",
              " 'Villard, attended Edison\\'s 1879 demonstration. Villard was impressed and requested Edison install Villard electric lighting system aboard Villard\\'s company\\'s new steamer, the Columbia. Although hesitant at first, Edison agreed to Villard\\'s request. Most of the work was completed in May 1880, and the Columbia went to New York City, where Edison and his personnel installed Columbia\\'s new lighting system. The Columbia was Edison\\'s first commercial application for his incandescent light bulb. The Edison equipment was removed from Columbia in 1895.In 1880, Lewis Latimer, a draftsman and an expert witness in patent litigation, began working for the United States Electric Lighting Company run by Edison\\'s rival Hiram S. Maxim. While working for Maxim, Latimer invented a process for making carbon filaments for light bulbs and helped install broad-scale lighting systems for New York City, Philadelphia, Montreal, and London. Latimer holds the patent for the electric lamp issued in 1881, and a second patent for the “process of manufacturing carbons” the filament used in incandescent light bulbs, issued in 1882.On October 8, 1883, the US patent office ruled that Edison\\'s patent was based on the work of William E. Sawyer and was, therefore, invalid. Litigation continued for nearly six years. In 1885, Latimer switched camps and started working with Edison. On October 6, 1889, a judge ruled that Edison\\'s electric light improvement claim for \"a filament of carbon of high resistance\" was valid. To avoid a possible court battle with yet another competitor, Joseph Swan, whose British patent had been awarded a year before Edison\\'s, he and Swan formed a joint company called Ediswan to manufacture and market the invention in Britain.The incandescent light bulb patented by Edison also began to gain widespread popularity in Europe as well. Mahen Theatre in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic, opened in 1882, and was the first public building in the world to use Edison\\'s electric lamps. Francis Jehl, Edison\\'s assistant in the invention of the lamp, supervised the installation. In September 2010, a sculpture of three giant light bulbs was erected in Brno, in front of the theatre. The first Edison light bulbs in the Nordic countries were installed at the weaving hall of the Finlayson\\'s textile factory in Tampere, Finland in March 1882.',\n",
              " ' Electric power distribution After devising a commercially viable electric light bulb on October 21, 1879, Edison developed an electric \"utility\" to compete with the existing gas light utilities. On December 17, 1880, he founded the Edison Illuminating Company, and during the 1880s, he patented a system for electricity distribution. the Edison Illuminating Company established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882 on Pearl Street Station, New York City. On September 4, 1882, Edison switched on he Pearl Street generating station\\'s electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current DC to 59 customers in lower Manhattan.In January 1882, Edison switched on the first steam-generating power station at Holborn Viaduct in London. his Pearl Street generating station\\'s electrical power distribution system, which provided 110 volts direct current DC provided electricity supplies to street lamps and several private dwellings within a short distance of the station. On January 19, 1883, the first standardized incandescent electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle, New Jersey.',\n",
              " 'As Edison expanded his direct current DC power delivery system, his received stiff competition from companies installing alternating current AC systems. From the early 1880s, AC arc lighting systems for streets and large spaces had been an expanding business in the US. With the development of transformers in Europe and by Westinghouse Electric in the US in 1885–1886, it became possible to transmit AC long distances over thinner and cheaper wires, and \"step down\" reduce the voltage at the destination for distribution to users. This allowed AC to be used in street lighting and in lighting for small business and domestic customers, the market Edison\\'s patented low voltage DC incandescent lamp system was designed to supply. Edison empire suffered from one of Edison\\'s DC empire chief drawbacks: Edison\\'s DC empire was suitable only for the high density of customers found in large cities. Edison plants could not deliver electricity to customers more than one mile from the plant, and left a patchwork of unsupplied customers between plants. Small cities and rural areas could not afford an Edison style system at all, leaving a large part of the market without electrical service. AC companies expanded into this gap.Edison expressed views that AC was unworkable and the high voltages used were dangerous. As George Westinghouse installed his first AC systems in 1886, Thomas Edison struck out personally against Edison chief rival stating, \"Just as certain as death, Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after Edison puts in a system of any size. Edison has got a new thing and a new thing will require a great deal of experimenting to get a new thing working practically.\" Many reasons have been suggested for Edison\\'s anti-AC stance. One notion is that the inventor could not grasp the more abstract theories behind AC and was trying to avoid developing a system the inventor did not understand. Edison also appeared to have been worried about the high voltage from misinstalled AC systems killing customers and hurting the sales of electric power systems in general. Primary was the fact that Edison Electric based Edison Electric design on low voltage DC and switching a standard after Edison Electric had installed over 100 systems was, in Edison\\'s mind, out of the question. By the end of 1887, Edison Electric was losing market share to Westinghouse, who had built 68 AC-based power stations to Edison\\'s 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison built 22 power stations.Parallel to expanding competition between Edison and the AC companies was rising public furor over a series of deaths in the spring of 1888 caused by pole mounted high voltage alternating current lines.  This turned into a media frenzy against high voltage alternating current and the seemingly greedy and callous lighting companies that used This. Edison took advantage of the public perception of AC as dangerous, and joined with self-styled New York anti-AC crusader Harold P. Brown in a propaganda campaign, aiding Brown in the public electrocution of animals with AC, and supported legislation to control and severely limit AC installations and voltages to the point of making Edison an ineffective power delivery system in what was now being referred to as a \"battle of currents\". The development of the electric chair was used in an attempt to portray AC as having a greater lethal potential than DC and smear Westinghouse at the same time via Edison colluding with Brown and Westinghouse\\'s chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, to make sure the first electric chair was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.Edison staunch anti-AC tactics were not sitting well with Edison own stockholders. By the early 1890s, Edison\\'s company was generating much smaller profits than Edison\\'s company AC rivals, and the War of Currents would come to an end in 1892 with Edison forced out of controlling his own company. That year, the financier J.P. Morgan engineered a merger of Edison General Electric with Thomson-Houston that put the board of Thomson-Houston in charge of the new company called General Electric. General Electric now controlled three-quarters of the US electrical business and would compete with Westinghouse for the AC market.',\n",

              " 'Edison moved from Menlo Park after the death of Edison first wife, Mary, in 1884, and purchased a home known as \"Glenmont\" in 1886 as a wedding gift for Edison second wife, Mina, in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey. In 1885, Thomas Edison bought 13 acres of property in Fort Myers, Florida, for roughly $2,750 equivalent to $79,210 in 2020 and built what was later called Seminole Lodge as a winter retreat. The main house and guest house are representative of Italianate architecture and Queen Anne style architecture. The building materials were pre-cut in New England by the Kennebec Framing Company and the Stephen Nye Lumber Company of Fairfield Maine. The materials were then shipped down by boat and were constructed at a cost of $12,000 each, which included the cost of interior furnishings. Edison and Mina spent many winters at Edison and Mina home in Fort Myers, and Edison tried to find a domestic source of natural rubber.Due to the security concerns around World War I, Edison suggested forming a science and industry committee to provide advice and research to the US military, and he headed the Naval Consulting Board in 1915.Edison became concerned with America\\'s reliance on foreign supply of rubber and was determined to find a native supply of rubber.  Edison\\'s work on rubber took place largely at he research laboratory in Fort Myers, which has been designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark.The laboratory was built after Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and Harvey Firestone pulled together $75,000 to form the Edison Botanical Research Corporation. Initially, only Ford and Firestone were to contribute funds to the project, while Edison did all the research. Edison, however, wished to contribute $25,000 as well. Edison did the majority of the research and planting, sending results and sample rubber residues to Edison West Orange Lab. Edison employed a two-part Acid-base extraction, to derive latex from the plant material after Edison was dried and crushed to a powder. After testing 17,000 plant samples, Edison eventually found an adequate source in the Goldenrod plant. Edison decided on Solidago leavenworthii, also known as Leavenworth\\'s Goldenrod. The plant, which normally grows roughly 3–4 feet tall with a 5% latex yield, was adapted by Edison through cross-breeding to produce plants twice the size and with a latex yield of 12%.During the 1911 New York Electrical show, Edison told representatives of the copper industry it was a shame Edison didn\\'t have a \"chunk of it\". The representatives decided to give a cubic foot of solid copper weighing 486 pounds with representatives of the copper industry gratitude inscribed on it in appreciation for Edison part in the \"continuous stimulation in the copper industry\".',\n",

Until Edison discovered that calcium tungstate fluoroscopy screens produced brighter images than the barium platinocyanide screens originally used by Wilhelm Röntgen, the technology was capable of producing only very faint images.The fundamental design of Edison\\'s fluoroscope is still in use today, although Edison abandoned the project after nearly losing his own eyesight and seriously injuring his assistant, Clarence Dally. Dally made Dally an enthusiastic human guinea pig for the fluoroscopy project and was exposed to a poisonous dose of radiation Dally later died at the age of 39 of injuries related to the exposure, mediastinal cancer.In 1903, a shaken Edison said: \"Don\\'t talk to Dally about X-rays, I am afraid of them.\" Nonetheless, Dally work was important in the development of a technology still used today.',\n",
              " ' Tasimeter Edison invented a highly sensitive device, that Edison named the tasimeter, which measured infrared radiation.  Edison impetus for Edison creation was the desire to measure the heat from the solar corona during the total Solar eclipse of July 29, 1878. The device was not patented since Edison could find no practical mass-market application for a highly sensitive device.',\n",
              " \" Telegraph improvements The key to Edison's initial reputation and success was his work in the field of telegraphy. With knowledge gained from years of working as a telegraph operator, his learned the basics of electricity. This, together with his studies in chemistry at the Cooper Union, allowed his to make his early fortune with the stock ticker, the first electricity-based broadcast system. his innovations also included the development of the quadruplex, the first system which could simultaneously transmit four messages through a single wire.\",\n",
              " 'Edison was granted a patent for a motion picture camera, labeled the \"Kinetograph\". Edison did the electromechanical design while Edison employee William Kennedy Dickson, a photographer, worked on the photographic and optical development. Much of the credit for the invention belongs to Dickson. In 1891, Thomas Edison built a Kinetoscope or peep-hole viewer. This device was installed in penny arcades, where people could watch short, simple films. The kinetograph and kinetoscope were both first publicly exhibited May 20, 1891.In April 1896, Thomas Armat\\'s Vitascope, manufactured by the Edison factory and marketed in Edison\\'s name, was used to project motion pictures in public screenings in New York City. Later, Edison exhibited motion pictures with voice soundtrack on cylinder recordings, mechanically synchronized with the film.Officially the kinetoscope entered Europe when wealthy American businessman Irving T. Bush 1869–1948 bought from the Continental Commerce Company of Frank Z. Maguire and Joseph D. Baucus a dozen machines. Bush placed from October 17, 1894, the first kinetoscopes in London. At the same time, the French company Kinétoscope Edison Michel et Alexis Werner bought these machines for the market in France. In the last three months of 1894, the Continental Commerce Company sold hundreds of kinetoscopes in Europe i.e. the Netherlands and Italy. In Germany and in Austria-Hungary, the kinetoscope was introduced by the Deutsche-österreichische-Edison-Kinetoscop Gesellschaft, founded by the Ludwig Stollwerck of the Schokoladen-Süsswarenfabrik Stollwerck  Co of Cologne.The first kinetoscopes arrived in Belgium at the Fairs in early 1895. The Edison\\'s Kinétoscope Français, a Belgian company, was founded in Brussels on January 15, 1895, with the rights to sell the kinetoscopes in Monaco, France and the French colonies. The main investors in the Continental Commerce Company were Belgian industrialists.On May 14, 1895, the Edison\\'s Kinétoscope Belge was founded in Brussels. Businessman Ladislas-Victor Lewitzki, living in London but active in Belgium and France, took the initiative in starting this business. He had contacts with Leon Gaumont and the American Mutoscope and Biograph Co. In 1898, He also became a shareholder of the Biograph and Mutoscope Company for France.Edison\\'s film studio made nearly 1,200 films. The majority of the productions were short films showing everything from acrobats to parades to fire calls including titles such as Fred Ott\\'s Sneeze 1894, The Kiss 1896, The Great Train Robbery 1903, Alice\\'s Adventures in Wonderland 1910, and the first Frankenstein film in 1910. In 1903, when the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island announced the owners of Luna Park, Coney Island would execute Topsy the elephant by strangulation, poisoning, and electrocution with the electrocution part ultimately killing the elephant, Edison Manufacturing sent a crew to film Edison Manufacturing, releasing Edison Manufacturing that same year with the title Electrocuting an Elephant.',\n",
              " 'As the film business expanded, competing exhibitors routinely copied and exhibited each other\\'s films. To better protect the copyrights on each other\\'s films films, Edison deposited prints of Edison on long strips of photographic paper with the U.S. copyright office. Many of these paper prints survived longer and in better condition than the actual films of that era.In 1908, Edison started the Motion Picture Patents Company, which was a conglomerate of nine major film studios commonly known as the Edison Trust. Thomas Edison was the first honorary fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, which was founded in 1929.Edison said Edison favorite movie was The Birth of a Nation. Edison thought that talkies had \"spoiled everything\" for Edison. \"There isn\\'t any good acting on the screen. They concentrate on the voice now and have forgotten how to act. I can sense it more than you because I am deaf.\" Edison favorite stars were Mary Pickford and Clara Bow.',\n",
              " ' Mining Starting in the late 1870s, Edison became interested and involved with mining. High-grade iron ore was scarce on the east coast of the United States and Edison tried to mine low-grade ore. Edison developed a process using rollers and crushers that could pulverize rocks up to 10 tons. The dust was then sent between three giant magnets that would pull the iron ore from the dust. Despite the failure of his mining company, the Edison Ore Milling Company, Edison used some of the materials and equipment to produce cement.In 1901, Edison visited an industrial exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits there could be used in his production of electrical equipment. his returned as a mining prospector and is credited with the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body. his attempts to mine Falconbridge Mines were not successful, and his abandoned his mining claim in 1903. A street in Falconbridge, as well as the Edison Building, which served as the head office of Falconbridge Mines, are named for his.',\n",
              " 'In the late 1890s, Edison worked on developing a lighter, more efficient rechargeable battery at that time called an \"accumulator\". He looked on them as something customers could use to power them phonographs but saw other uses for an improved battery, including electric automobiles. The then available lead acid rechargeable batteries were not very efficient and that market was already tied up by other companies so Edison pursued using alkaline instead of acid. He had He lab work on many types of materials going through some 10,000 combinations, eventually settling on a nickel-iron combination. Besides He experimenting Edison also probably had access to the 1899 patents for a nickel–iron battery by the Swedish inventor Waldemar Jungner.Edison obtained a US and European patent for his nickel–iron battery in 1901 and founded the Edison Storage Battery Company, and by 1904 Edison had 450 people working there. The first rechargeable batteries 450 people produced were for electric cars, but there were many defects, with customers complaining about the product. When the capital of Edison was exhausted, Edison paid for Edison with Edison private money. Edison did not demonstrate a mature product until 1910: a very efficient and durable nickel-iron-battery with lye as the electrolyte. The nickel–iron battery was never very successful by the time The nickel–iron battery was ready, electric cars were disappearing, and lead acid batteries had become the standard for turning over gas-powered car starter motors.',\n",
              " ' Chemicals At the start of World War I, the American chemical industry was primitive.  Most chemicals were imported from Europe.  The outbreak of war in August 1914 resulted in an immediate shortage of imported chemicals.  One of particular importance to Edison was phenol, which was used to make phonograph records—presumably as phenolic resins of the Bakelite type.At the time, Phenol came from coal as a by-product of coke oven gases or manufactured gas for gas lighting.  Phenol could be nitrated to picric acid and converted to ammonium picrate, a shock resistant high explosive suitable for use in artillery shells.  A telling of the phenol story is found in The Aspirin Wars. Most phenol had been imported from Britain, but with war, Parliament blocked exports and diverted most to production of ammonium picrate.  Britain also blockaded supplies from Germany.Edison responded by undertaking production of phenol at Edison Silver Lake facility using processes developed by Edison chemists. Edison built two plants with a capacity of six tons of phenol per day.  Production began the first week of September, one month after hostilities began in Europe.  Edison built two plants to produce raw material benzene at Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Bessemer, Alabama, replacing supplies previously from Germany.  Edison also manufactured aniline dyes, which previously had been supplied by the German dye trust.  Other wartime products include xylene, p-phenylenediamine, shellac, and pyrax.  Wartime shortages made these ventures profitable.  In 1915, his production capacity was fully committed by midyear.Phenol was a critical material because two derivatives were in high growth phases. Bakelite, the original thermoset plastic, had been invented in 1909. Aspirin, too was a phenol derivative.  Invented in 1899, Phenol had become a block buster drug. Bayer had acquired a plant to manufacture in the US in Rensselaer, New York, but struggled to find phenol to keep phenol plant running during the war.  Edison was able to oblige.Bayer relied on Chemische Fabrik von Heyden, in Piscataway, New Jersey, to convert phenol to salicylic acid, which phenol converted to aspirin.  See Great Phenol plot. It is said that German companies bought up supplies of phenol to block production of ammonium picrate.  Edison preferred not to sell phenol for military uses.  Edison sold Edison surplus to Bayer, who had his surplus converted to salicylic acid by Heyden, some of which was exported.',\n",
              " \" Spirit Phone In 1920, Edison spoke to American Magazine, saying that he had been working on a device for some time to see if it was possible to communicate with the dead. Edison said the device would work on scientific principles not by an occult means. The announcement caused a press heyday, though the actual nature of this invention remained a mystery, as there were no details for some time. Until In 2015, Philippe Baudouin, a French journalist, found a copy of Edison's Diary in a thrift store with a chapter not found in the previously published editions. The new chapter details Edison's theories of the afterlife and the scientific basis by which communication  with them might be achieved.\",\n",
              " 'Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison at a convention of affiliated Edison illuminating companies in Brooklyn, NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford\\'s internal combustion engine automobile and encouraged Edison developments. Edison were friends until Edison\\'s death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also participated.In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. John Burroughs believed strongly in the organization, writing that \"The Civitan Club is doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in it ranks.\" John Burroughs was an active member in the club until John Burroughs death, sometimes bringing Henry Ford to the club\\'s meetings.Edison was active in business right up to the end. Just months before John Burroughs death, the Lackawanna Railroad inaugurated suburban electric train service from Hoboken to Montclair, Dover, and Gladstone, New Jersey. Electrical transmission for this service was by means of an overhead catenary system using direct current, which Edison had championed. Despite John Burroughs frail condition, Edison was at the throttle of the first electric MU Multiple-Unit train to depart Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken in September 1930, driving the train the first mile through Hoboken yard on Edison way to South Orange.This fleet of cars would serve commuters in northern New Jersey for the next 54 years until This fleet of cars retirement in 1984. A plaque commemorating Edison\\'s inaugural ride can be seen today in the waiting room of Lackawanna Terminal in Hoboken, which is presently operated by New Jersey Transit.Edison was said to have been influenced by a popular fad diet in Edison last few years \"the only liquid Edison consumed was a pint of milk every three hours\". Edison is reported to have believed this diet would restore Edison health. However, this tale is doubtful. In 1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about Edison, \"Correct eating is one of Edison greatest hobbies.\" Mina also said that during one of Edison periodic \"great scientific adventures\", Edison would be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or dinner, implying that Edison continued to have all three.Edison became the owner of Edison Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On Edison last visit, in 1923, Edison was reportedly shocked to find Edison old home still lit by lamps and candles.',\n",

C. Forbes of American Magazine that He was working on a \"spirit phone\" to allow communication with the dead, a story which other newspapers and magazines repeated. Edison later disclaimed the idea, telling the New York Times in 1926 that \"I really had nothing to tell He, but I hated to disappoint He so I thought up this story about communicating with spirits, but it was all a joke.\"',\n",

Edison said in 1915, \"Every woman in this country is going to have the vote.\" Edison notably signed onto a statement supporting women\\'s suffrage which was published to counter anti-suffragist literature spread by Senator James Edgar Martine.Nonviolence was key to Edison\\'s political and moral views, and when asked to serve as a naval consultant for World War I, Nonviolence specified Nonviolence would work only on defensive weapons and later noted, \"I am proud of the fact that I never invented weapons to kill.\" Edison\\'s philosophy of nonviolence extended to animals as well, about which Nonviolence stated: \"Nonviolence leads to the highest ethics, which is the goal of all evolution. Until we stop harming all other living beings, we are still savages.\" Nonviolence was a vegetarian but not a vegan in actual practice, at least near the end of Nonviolence life. Following a tour of Europe in 1911, Edison spoke negatively about \"the belligerent nationalism that Nonviolence had sensed in every country Nonviolence visited”.Edison was an advocate for monetary reform in the United States. Nonviolence was ardently opposed to the gold standard and debt-based money. Famously, Nonviolence was quoted in the New York Times as stating: \"Gold is a relic of Julius Caesar, and interest is an invention of Satan.\" In the same article, Nonviolence expounded upon the absurdity of a monetary system in which the taxpayer of the United States, in need of a loan, can be compelled to pay in return perhaps double the principal, or even greater sums, due to interest. Edison argued that, if the government can produce debt-based money, Edison could equally as well produce money that was a credit to the taxpayer.In May 1922, he published a proposal, entitled \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\". In a proposal, entitled \"A Proposed Amendment to the Federal Reserve Banking System\", he detailed an explanation of a commodity-backed currency, in which the Federal Reserve would issue interest-free currency to farmers, based on the value of commodities farmers produced. During a publicity tour that he took with friend and fellow inventor, Henry Ford, he spoke publicly about he desire for monetary reform.
