# Knowledge-base-from-scratch

The goal of this project is to build Knowledge Base (NB) from scratch which involves imposing a structure on
unstructured data and extracting facts about entities and storing them in a knowledge graph that facilitates the
information retrieval process. KB simplifies the web content which is called semantic web as it is more convenient for a customer to find
the required information directly other than searching in blue links. Due to the availability of a huge amount of
data, it is better to apply the semantic analysis to provide the answer directly to user queries other than keeping it
hidden in the web pages which requires more effort from the user
